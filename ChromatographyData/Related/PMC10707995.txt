Title: Preanalytical Quality Evaluation of Citrate Evacuated Blood Collection Tubes-Ultraviolet Molecular Absorption Spectrometry Confronted with Ion Chromatography.

Abstract: We previously enabled a direct insight into the quality of citrate anticoagulant tubes before their intended use for specimen collection by introducing an easy-to-perform UV spectrometric method for citrate determination on a purified water model. The results revealed differences between the tubes of three producers, Greiner BIO-ONE (A), LT Burnik (B), and BD (C). It became apparent that tubes C contain an additive, which absorbs light in the ultraviolet range and prevents reliable evaluation of citrate anticoagulant concentration with the suggested method. In this research, we re-evaluate the quality of citrate-evacuated blood collection tubes by complementing UV spectrometry with ion chromatography. (1) Comparable results were obtained for tubes B at 220 nm. (2) Citrate concentrations determined with ion chromatography were lower for tubes A and C. Chromatograms reveal additional peaks for both. (3) Influences of heparin on absorption spectra and chromatograms of citrate were studied. Some similarities with the shape of the anticoagulant spectra of tubes A and C were observed, and the lithium heparin peak in chromatograms is close to them, but a confident judgment was not possible. (4) Contamination of anticoagulant solution with potassium, magnesium, and calcium was confirmed for all the brands, and contamination with lithium for B and C.
