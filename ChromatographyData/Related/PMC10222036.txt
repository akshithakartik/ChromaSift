Title: Characteristics, Isolation Methods, and Biological Properties of Aucubin.

Abstract: Aucubin is an iridoid glycoside widely spread in the families &lt;i&gt;Cornaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Garryaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Orobanchaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Globulariaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eucommiaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Scrophulariaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Plantaginaceae&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Rubiaceae&lt;/i&gt;. This review is intended to provide data on the physicochemical characteristics, isolation methods, and biological activities of aucubin and its producing plants. Aucubin is unstable and can be deglycosylated into its aglycone, aucubigenin. Various chromatographic methods (column chromatography, vacuum liquid chromatography, medium pressure liquid chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography) have been used together to isolate aucubin, mainly with the stationary phase C-18 and the mobile phase water-methanol solution made in gradients. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal that aucubin has a wide range of activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anxiolytic and antidepressant, antidiabetic, antifibrotic, antimicrobial, anticancer, antihyperlipidemic, gastroprotective, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, retinoprotective, neuroprotective, osteoprotective, and renoprotective. Even though aucubin has been extensively investigated, further research in humans is urgently needed primarily to substantiate the clinical evidence. Moreover, extensive studies on its drug delivery systems will help maximize efficacy and minimize side effects.
