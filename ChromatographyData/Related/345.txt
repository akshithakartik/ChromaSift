Title: Applications of two-dimensional ion chromatography for analytes determination in environmental matrix: A review

Abstract: Ion chromatography (IC) has grown in usage rapidly since its first introduction in 1975. However, IC is still sometimes unable to separate target analytes from coexisting components well with identical elution time, due to the limited resolution and column capacity, especially in the presence of high-level salt matrix. These limitations hence drive IC to develop two-dimensional IC (2D-IC). In this review, we capture the 2D-IC applications in environmental samples via the perspective of coupling different IC columns, which aim to summarize where these 2D-IC methods fit in. In sequence, we firstly review the principles of 2D-IC and emphasize one-pump column-switching IC (OPCS IC) because it is a simplified 2D-IC that only uses one set of IC system. We then compare typical 2D-IC and OPCS IC performances in terms of application scope, method detection limit, drawbacks, and expectations. Finally, we propose some challenges of current methods and opportunities for future research. For instance, it is challenging to couple anion exchange column and capillary column in OPCS IC due to the incompatibility between flow path dimensions and suppressor; coupling ion exclusion column and mixed-bed column may be promising to simultaneously determine anions and cations in weak acids or salts. The details of this study may help practitioners to better understand and implement 2D-IC methods and meanwhile motivate researchers to fill in the knowledge gap in the future.
