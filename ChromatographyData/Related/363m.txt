Title: Separation of natural compounds using eutectic solvent-based biphasic systems and centrifugal partition chromatography

Abstract: A study on the formation of ternary biphasic systems composed of heptane, 1-butanol or ethyl acetate and type III or type V deep eutectic solvents based on levulinic acid and choline chloride or thymol was carried. Binodal curves and densities and phase compositions of phases in equilibrium for seven systems are reported. The partition coefficients of six natural compounds, namely quercetin, apigenin, coumarin, β-ionone, retinol, and α-tocopherol, in these systems were measured. Results show that the influence of choline chloride on the partition coefficients is more significant in systems with 1-butanol or ethyl acetate than previously reported for ethanol, and that the separation of natural compounds is worst when using DES containing thymol instead of choline chloride. Based on these partition coefficients, one system composed of heptane, 1-butanol and the DES choline chloride:levulinic acid at molar ratio 1:3 was selected to be applied in centrifugal partition chromatography, and the results obtained confirmed that it allows a good separation of apigenin, coumarin, β-ionone and α-tocopherol.
