Title: The inorganic chemistry of the cobalt corrinoids – an update

Abstract: The inorganic chemistry of the cobalt corrinoids, derivatives of vitamin B12, is reviewed, with particular emphasis on equilibrium constants for, and kinetics of, their axial ligand substitution reactions. The role the corrin ligand plays in controlling and modifying the properties of the metal ion is emphasised. Other aspects of the chemistry of these compounds, including their structure, corrinoid complexes with metals other than cobalt, the redox chemistry of the cobalt corrinoids and their chemical redox reactions, and their photochemistry are discussed. Their role as catalysts in non-biological reactions and aspects of their organometallic chemistry are briefly mentioned. Particular mention is made of the role that computational methods – and especially DFT calculations – have played in developing our understanding of the inorganic chemistry of these compounds. A brief overview of the biological chemistry of the B12-dependent enzymes is also given for the reader's convenience.
