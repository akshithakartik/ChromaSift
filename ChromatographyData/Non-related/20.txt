Title: Recent advances in the chemistry of selenophenopyridine heterocycles: Synthesis, reactivity and biological activity

Abstract: Pyridine and selenophene are valuable heterocyclic compounds that play a crucial role in the development of new drug molecules. Combining the selenophene and pyridine moieties in hybrid structures has opened up exciting possibilities for various pharmacological activities, leading to the discovery of selenophenopyridines, including selenopheno[2,3-b]pyridine, selenopheno[3,2-b]pyridine, selenopheno[2,3-c]pyridine, selenopheno-[3,2-c]pyridine, and diselenopheno[2,3-b:3′,2′-d]pyridine, all of which exhibit intriguing properties. The synthesis of selenophenopyridines can be accomplished through several chemical reactions: Friedländer reaction, Thorpe–Ziegler cyclization, Suzuki cross-coupling and Sonogashira coupling reactions
