Title: Quantitative studies of single-molecule chemistry using conductance measurement

Abstract: Recent advances in single-molecule electronics hold promise to go beyond the initial idea of constructing molecular devices and offer new opportunities to investigate single-molecule chemistry using single-molecule characterization techniques. In the early stage of molecular electronics, the majority of progress is made by the qualitative analysis of electrical properties, while in recent years, the quantitative analysis of the physical and chemical behavior of single molecules attracted increasing interest. In this review, we will introduce the recent development of the single-molecule quantitative analysis technique and its applications in studying dynamic molecular configurations, redox states, single-molecule reactions, single-molecule sensing, and molecular adsorption behaviors from the single-molecule level.
