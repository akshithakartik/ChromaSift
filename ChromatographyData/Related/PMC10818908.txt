Title: Authentication of Fennel, Star Anise, and Anise Essential Oils by Gas Chromatography (GC/MS) and Stable Isotope Ratio (GC/IRMS) Analyses.

Abstract: The aromatic compound (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-anethol is widely used in the flavor, fragrance, and medicinal industries. This compound is commonly produced through steam distillation of fennel, star anise, and anise seed. Given the cost of production, these natural and authentic essential oils are commonly adulterated with lower-cost natural materials or synthetic alternatives. The current study investigates essential oil profiles (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) and stable isotope ratios (gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry) of the abundant compound (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-anethol in both authentic reference standards (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) and commercially available samples (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 30). This multifaceted analytical approach establishes techniques for ensuring the authenticity of essential oil sources of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-anethol and was then used to evaluate the current essential oil market sources of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-anethol. These findings report that adulteration of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-anethol-containing natural products takes various forms, and a multifaceted analytical approach is recommended for authentication. Of the commercial samples analyzed for this report, 27% were adulterated.
