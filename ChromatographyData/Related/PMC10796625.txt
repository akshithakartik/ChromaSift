Title: Biodiesel production potential of Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms: comparison of collection sites and different alcohol transesterifications.

Abstract: Renewable resources have stood out as raw materials in producing biofuels. This study aimed to evaluate the parameters of alcohol transesterification (ethanol and methanol) and localization of collection of aquatic macrophyte Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms in the production of biodiesel by in situ transesterification. E. crassipes was collected in Dourados and Corumb\xc3\xa1 (Brazil) municipalities. The fatty acid ester composition of the biodiesel was characterized and quantified by gas chromatography. The biodiesel properties were estimated using the BiodieselAnalyzer\xc2\xa9 program prediction. The ethyl transesterification resulted in higher yields, but the localization of collection was the most relevant parameter in biodiesel production according to the Permutation Multivariate Analysis of Variance. The simulation and comparison of the physical-chemical properties of E. crassipes biodiesel and BD 100 (commercial biodiesel) were promising for commercial application.
