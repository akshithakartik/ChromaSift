Title: Overview of sixteen green analytical chemistry metrics for evaluation of the greenness of analytical methods

Abstract: Green analytical chemistry (GAC) is a concept to encourage using energy-saving instruments, decreasing the use of toxic agents or compounds, and producing waste with a minimal amount during analytical procedures. The concept of GAC is widely recognized in analytical chemistry laboratories. Simple, comprehensive and flexible greenness metrics should be developed and applied to evaluate the impacts of analytical procedures on the environment, human health and human safety. Sixteen greenness metrics just like National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), Analytical Eco-scale, Analytical method volume intensity (AMVI), Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) and Analytical Greenness Calculator (AGREE) are chosen as the typical greenness metrics in this review. The considering criteria, characteristics, advantages, disadvantages and applications of these sixteen GAC metric tools will be introduced and discussed in this article. We hope this review is helpful for analyst to use different metrics to assess the greenness of different analytical procedures.
