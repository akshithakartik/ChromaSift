Title: A composite hydrogel modified silica stationary phase for mixed‑mode liquid chromatography

Abstract: A novel composite hydrogel functionalized silica core-shell stationary phase was prepared by the surface modification of silica sphere. The successful synthesis of the new stationary phase (T-Sil@PAM/SA/UiO-66-NH2) was proven by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), etc. Due to the coexistence of amide, hydroxyl, long carbon chain and UiO-66-NH2 in composite hydrogel shell, the obtained stationary phase can be used in hydrophilic/reversed-phase liquid chromatography with multiple retention mechanisms, such as hydrophilic, hydrophobic and π - π interactions. The chromatographic retention behavior of T-Sil@PAM/SA/UiO-66-NH2 demonstrated that the new stationary phase showed excellent separation performance for both polar analytes (such as alkaloids, saccharides, etc.) and nonpolar analytes (such as substituted benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), etc.). Furthermore, compared with NH2 column and commercial C18 column, the T-Sil@PAM/SA/UiO-66-NH2 exhibited a certain superiority. Moreover, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of PAHs’ retention time with eight replicates consecutive elution was found to range from 0.03% to 0.17%. Therefore, the successful use of T-Sil@PAM/SA/UiO-66-NH2 in mixed‑mode liquid chromatography expanded the potential applications of hydrogels in the field of separation.
