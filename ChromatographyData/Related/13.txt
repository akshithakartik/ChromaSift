Title: Recent approaches to the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of modified deoxynucleosides as biomarkers in clinical research

Abstract: Chromatographic techniques have found wide application in the quantitative analysis of modified deoxynucleosides in DNA and biological fluids, which is also reflected in clinical research. Recently most determinations have been made using ultra/high-pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Increasing the reliability of the results forces the use of internal standards labeled with stable isotopes. Progressing automation is also noticeable at the preparation level and chromatographic analysis. This review article focuses on the recent developments and advances related to the use of deoxynucleosides quantification in clinical applications by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. We also direct attention to the potential sources and importance of the contamination in this type of analysis.
