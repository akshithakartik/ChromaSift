Title: Identification and quantification of polymeric impurity in block copolymer by one-dimensional and two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry and evaporative light scattering detector

Abstract: Identifying and quantifying polymeric impurities in a polymeric material is critical for understanding material quality and performance, but it remains a challenge requiring developing new characterization methods. In this work, a comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography method with simultaneous evaporative light scattering and high-resolution mass spectrometry detection was developed to separate and identify a polymeric impurity in alkyl alcohol-initiated polyethylene oxide/polybutylene oxide diblock copolymer. Size exclusion chromatography was implemented in the first dimension, and gradient reversed-phase liquid chromatography using a large-pore C4 column was applied in the second dimension using an active solvent modulation valve as the interface to minimize the polymer breakthrough. The two-dimensional separation significantly reduced the complexity of the mass spectra data compared to the one-dimensional separation, and the combination of retention time and mass spectral interpretation led to the successful identification of the water-initiated triblock copolymer impurity. This identification was confirmed by comparison with the synthesized triblock copolymer reference material. A one-dimensional LC method with evaporative light scattering detection was employed to quantify the triblock impurity. The impurity level in three samples made with the different processes was determined to be in the range of 9â€“18 wt% using the triblock reference material as the standard.
