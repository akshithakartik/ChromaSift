Title: Phase-separation multiphase flow: preliminary application to analytical chemistry.

Abstract: A two-phase separation mixed solution can undergo phase separation from one phase to two phases (i.e., upper and lower phases) in a batch vessel in response to changes in temperature and/or pressure. This phase separation is reversible. When the mixed solution undergoes a phase change while being fed into a microspace region, a dynamic liquid-liquid interface is formed, leading to a multiphase structure. This flow is called a phase-separation multiphase flow. Annular flow in a microspace, which is one such phase-separation multiphase flow, is interesting and has been applied to chromatography, extraction, reaction fields, and mixing. Here, research papers related to phase-separation multiphase flows-ranging from the discovery of the phenomenon to basic and technical research from the viewpoint of analytical science-are reviewed. In addition, the development of a new separation mode in a high-performance liquid chromatography system based on phase-separation multiphase flow is introduced.
