Title: An Efficient Expression and Purification Protocol for SpCas9 Nuclease and Evaluation of Different Delivery Methods of Ribonucleoprotein.

Abstract: The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system is a revolutionary tool for precise genome editing across various cell types. Ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), encompassing the Cas9 protein and guide RNA (gRNA), have emerged as a promising technique due to their increased specificity and reduced off-target effects. This method eliminates the need for plasmid DNA introduction, thereby preventing potential integration of foreign DNA into the target cell genome. Given the requirement for large quantities of highly purified protein in various Cas9 studies, we present an efficient and simple method for the preparation of recombinant &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pyogenes&lt;/i&gt; Cas9 (SpCas9) protein. This method leverages the Small Ubiquitin Like Modifier(SUMO) tag system, which includes metal-affinity chromatography followed by anion-exchange chromatography purification. Furthermore, we compare two methods of CRISPR-Cas9 system delivery into cells: transfection with plasmid DNA encoding the CRISPR-Cas9 system and RNP transfection with the Cas9-gRNA complex. We estimate the efficiency of genomic editing and protein lifespan post-transfection. Intriguingly, we found that RNP treatment of cells, even in the absence of a transfection system, is a relatively efficient method for RNP delivery into cell culture. This discovery is particularly promising as it can significantly reduce cytotoxicity, which is crucial for certain cell cultures such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
