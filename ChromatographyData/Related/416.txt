Title: Universal response method for accurate quantitative analysis of the impurities in quinolone antibiotics using liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector and charged aerosol detector

Abstract: HPLC method is the standard method for the separation and quantification of impurities from quinolone antibiotics. However, due to the large differences in the UV absorption of the impurities in quinolone antibiotics, quantitative analysis without the availability of corresponding reference substances currently poses a challenge. A sensitive and direct method using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector and charged aerosol detector (HPLC-DAD-CAD) was developed for the analysis of impurities in quinolone antibiotics. The chromatographic conditions were optimized for good separation and output signal of CAD detector by response surface method (RSM). The systematic variation of CAD parameter settings, such as nebulization temperature, filter constant and power function value (PFV), were used to study the effect of on the detector response of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) and linearity for ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and their impurities. In the method validation, good linearity of each component was obtained with coefficient of determination (r) greater than 0.999 in the range of 0.5–300 μg mL−1. The average recoveries of each component were 99.02–102.39 % by DAD, were 98.22–101.91 % by CAD, RSDs were less than 2.5 % for intra-day and inter-day precision by DAD-CAD, with good precision and accuracy. The correction factor experimental results showed that the developed method provided a uniform response to the impurities with differences chromophores and could unbiasedly and directly detect the impurities in quinolone antibiotics. The method is first reported application of HPLC-DAD-CAD method for the analysis of impurities in quinolone antibiotics and it can be used for quality control of quinolone antibiotics.
