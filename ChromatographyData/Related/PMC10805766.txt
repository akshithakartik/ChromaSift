Title: HS-GC-IMS and HS-SPME/GC-MS coupled with E-nose and E-tongue reveal the flavors of raw milk from different regions of China.

Abstract: Milk authentication requires identification of the origin and assessment of the aroma characteristics. In this study, we analyzed 24 raw milk samples from different regions of China by profiling volatile flavors using headspace solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, headspace gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry, and intelligent sensory technology (E-tongue and E-nose). The flavor of raw milk in Southern and Northern China had evident differences based on the intelligent sensory technology. However, the differences among the samples from the northeast, northwest, and central regions were not significant. Correlations between milk origin and volatile compounds based on variable importance prediction &gt; 1 and principal component analysis results revealed differential compounds including pyridine, nonanal, dodecane, furfural, 1-decene, octanoic acid, and 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene. Our study findings provided a deeper understanding of the geographical differences in raw milk volatile compounds in China.
