Title: Optimizing the preparative capacity of two-dimensional liquid chromatography based on analytes retention behaviors

Abstract: In this work, a solute retention optimization method (SRO) was proposed to exploit the purification potential of two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC). According to our findings, the complementarity of 2D-LC correlates with some specific impurities. In the two methods used in 2D-LC, the retention order of these impurities and target compound is completely opposite. Taking full advantage of the complementarity is crucial to enhance the saturation capacity (w
                     max) of 2D-LC by SRO. For the purpose of validating the effectiveness of SRO, a reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) coupled with hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) was developed to purify p-chlorobenzoic acid from substituted benzenes. By using the overloading effects of analytes as indicators, the w
                     max of RPLC × HILIC was determined by the bisection method, and finally defined by the extremely high loading volume of 4.9 mL. A touch-peak separation of impurities and the target compound occurred precisely during the secondary separation. The effectiveness of SRO was also verified by the greater purification efficiency of RPLC × HILIC than that of HILIC × RPLC. Subsequently, a RPLC × RPLC method was developed by SRO to prepare the reference materials of caffeine from tea extracts. Only by an analytical C18 column, 15.6 mg of caffeine with the purity of 98.3% was obtained at once with the recovery up to 82.3%. However, without the aid of SRO, the purity rapidly decreased to 62.0%. Compared to other methods, SRO-based 2D-LC offers certain advantages in terms of purity, recovery, and the purification efficiency, suggesting that it is particularly effective in developing preparative 2D-LC facing complex matrices.
