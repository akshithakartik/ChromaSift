Title: Advantages of polar organic solvent chromatography for enantioseparation of chiral liquid crystals

Abstract: Three sets of fluorinated chiral liquid crystals were used to explore the polar organic solvent chromatography mode for their enantioseparation. The materials include a set of newly synthesized compounds with chiral center derived from 2-hexanol and two sets of compounds with chiral center derived from 2-/3-octanol. Baseline enantioseparation of all materials was achieved using binary mobile phases without additives. For some of the compounds exceedingly high values of enantioresolution (> 20) and enantioselectivity (> 4) were found. The chromatographic behavior of the sample set was studied on three different polysaccharide-based chiral columns – Chiralpak IA-U, IG-U and IB-U. Comparison of results from Chiralpak IA-U and IB-U shows the effect of amylose vs. cellulose polysaccharide backbone while comparison of Chiralpak IA-U and IG-U reveals the effect of 3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate vs. 3‑chloro-5-methylphenylcarbamate substituent. The mobile phases tested included whole range of acetonitrile/methanol mixtures to demonstrate that acetonitrile-rich and alcohol-rich mobile phases offer different enantiorecognition mechanisms and can provide complementarity to some extent. The effect of temperature on enantioseparation was investigated on Chiralpak IA-U by constructing van't Hoff plots for selected liquid crystals in pure acetonitrile and pure methanol as mobile phases.
