Title: Effect of Electron-Beam Irradiation on Functional Compounds and Biological Activities in Peanut Shells.

Abstract: Peanut shells, rich in antioxidants, remain underutilized due to limited research. The present study investigated the changes in the functional compound content and skin aging-related enzyme inhibitory activities of peanut shells by electron-beam treatment with different sample states and irradiation doses. In addition, phenolic compounds in the peanut shells were identified and quantified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with ion mobility mass spectrometry-quadrupole time-of-flight and high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector, respectively. Total phenolic compound content in solid treatment gradually increased from 110.31 to 189.03 mg gallic acid equivalent/g as the irradiation dose increased. Additionally, electron-beam irradiation significantly increased 5,7-dihydroxychrome, eriodictyol, and luteolin content in the solid treatment compared to the control. However, liquid treatment was less effective in terms of functional compound content compared to the solid treatment. The enhanced functional compound content in the solid treatment clearly augmented the antioxidant activity of the peanut shells irradiated with an electron-beam. Similarly, electron-beam irradiation substantially increased collagenase and elastase inhibitory activities in the solid treatment. Mutagenicity assay confirmed the stability of toxicity associated with the electron-beam irradiation. In conclusion, electron-beam-irradiated peanut shells could serve as an important by-product with potential applications in functional cosmetic materials.
