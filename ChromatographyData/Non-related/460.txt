Title: In-depth profiling of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolic footprints in rats using click chemistry-mass spectrometry probes

Abstract: Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), the most widely used plasticizers in the world, has been regarded as an endocrine disrupting chemical with serious adverse health outcomes. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that the undesirable biological effects of DEHP are meditated by its metabolites rather than itself. However, the metabolic footprints of DEHP in vivo are still unclear. Here we developed a click chemistry-assisted mass spectrometry (CC-MS) strategy for in-depth profiling DEHP metabolites in rats. An alkyne-modified DEHP analogue (alkyne-DEHP) was synthesized as a tracer for in vivo tracing, and a pair of MS probes (4-azido-nphenylbenzamide, 4-ANPA, and its deuterated reagent d
                     5-4-ANPA) were prepared to specifically label the alkyne-DEHP metabolites, and prominently improve their detection sensitivity and selectivity. Using the CC-MS strategy, we successfully screened 247 alkyne-DEHP metabolites from rat urine, feces, and serum, including many unrevealed metabolites, such as oxidized phthalate diester metabolites and glucuronides of phthalate monoester metabolites. The discovery of new DEHP metabolites provides additional insights for understanding the metabolism of DEHP, which may be beneficial in exploring the mechanism underlying DEHP induced-toxicity in the future.
