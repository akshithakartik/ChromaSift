Title: Multi-dimensional preparation of Thymus quinquecostatus Celak. by normal-phase flash chromatography coupled to counter-current chromatography

Abstract: In this study, a multi-dimensional chromatography system was developed by integrating normal-phase flash chromatography and counter-current chromatography to isolate flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, and thymol from the aerial parts of Thymus quinquecostatus Celak. In the online multi-dimensional switching system, a normal-phase flash chromatograph packed with 1.2 g of dry homogeneous silica gel mixture (containing 600 mg of methanol extract) was connected to counter-current chromatography via a six-port valve. Two two-dimensional separations were performed using n-heptane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (6:4:6:4, v/v) and ethyl acetate-water solvent systems sequentially to separate the constituents of Thymus quinquecostatus Celak. The upper phase of the former solvent system was utilized as both elution solvent for flash chromatography and the stationary phase for counter-current chromatography, while the lower phase of the latter solvent system containing 10 mM trifluoroacetic acid was employed as elution solvent for flash chromatography and one mobile phase in pH gradient counter-current chromatography. Thymol (7) and xanthomicrol (8), two hydrophobic ingredients, were purified in the initial two-dimensional separation. The subsequent two-dimensional separation yielded six hydrophilic compounds, namely dihydrokaempferol-7-O-D-glucopyranoside (1), lithospermic acid (2), luteolin-7-O-glucuronide (3), rosmarinic acid (4), messerschmidin (5) and apigenin-7-O-D-glucuronide (6). This study represents the first documented use of online multi-dimensional normal-phase flash chromatography coupled to counter-current chromatography for separating constituents from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak.
