Title: Triazole-modified Ru-carbene complexes: A valid olefin metathesis pre-catalyst for dynamic covalent chemistry via C=C bond formation

Abstract: Triazole-ruthenium carbene complexes (TA-Rus) were reported for the first time as a new class of modified Grubbs catalysts to achieve challenging olefin metathesis at higher temperatures without catalyst decomposition. Previously reported N-tethered Ru-carbene complexes all suffered from rapid cis-/trans-isomerization, causing significantly reduced catalyst reactivity. These new TA-Ru complexes hold the active trans-dichloro conformation even at 80°C, allowing effective olefin metathesis for challenging substrates. With this new TA-Ru catalyst, cross-metathesis (CM), ring-closing metathesis (RCM), and dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) were achieved. Excitingly, the reactivity of TA-Ru prevails all previously reported N-coordinated Ru-carbene pre-catalysts, Grubbs II, and Hoveyda-Grubbs, making TA-Rus a transformative catalytic system in olefin catalysis.
