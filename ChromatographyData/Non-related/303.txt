Title: Coordination chemistry-assisted ecofriendly preparation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded in hierarchical carbon for improved lithium storage

Abstract: The green and facile synthesis of high performance anodes is of significant importance for development of lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, a novel coordination chemistry-assisted method is demonstrated to successfully prepare a superior performance Fe2O3/C composite anode for LIBs. This method does not involve time-consuming pre-preparation of carbon materials and use of expensive sophisticated instruments and multiple harmful reagents, exhibiting relatively green and facile features over most of other methods. This Fe2O3/C composite consists of Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded in a porous carbon sheets assembled hierarchical matrix. Moreover, it finds that this beneficial architecture endows as-prepared Fe2O3/C with improved conductivity, enhanced kinetics, high capacitive contribution and good structure stability. In consequence, this Fe2O3/C anode exhibits superior electrochemical properties such as high capacity, long life and good rate performance, with 756.1 and 545.4 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 200 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. The relatively ecofriendly and simple preparation process as well as superior electrochemical performance make this Fe2O3/C anode promising for LIB application. This work also offers a guiding significance for designing and developing ecofriendly and facile preparation methods of other metal oxides/carbon composites for advanced LIB anodes.
