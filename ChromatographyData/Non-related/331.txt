Title: 1.04 Biradicals in main group chemistry: Synthesis, electronic structure, and application in small-molecule activation

Abstract: In this article, we review the concept of biradical(oid)s from a theoretical as well as experimental perspective. In particular, we analyze the “two electrons in two orbitals” model, which is frequently used to describe the electronic structure of biradical(oid)s, with special emphasis on systems with a small HOMO-LUMO gap, so-called open-shell singlet biradicals or singlet biradicaloids. We then revise the chemistry of main group analogs of cyclobutane-1,3-diyls and cyclopentane-1,3-diyls as typical examples of singlet biradical(oid)s. Lastly, it is shown how some of these biradicals can be applied as molecular switches by switching the biradical character on and off.
