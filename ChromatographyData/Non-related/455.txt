Title: Recent development of polysulfides: Chemistry and biological applications

Abstract: Polysulfides (RSSnSR, n ≥ 1) are a class of sulfane sulfur compounds that have gained significant recent attention due to their connections to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and hydropersulfides (RSSH), which are known to play important roles in redox signaling. While the potential regulatory functions of polysulfides in biological systems have been recognized for a long time, understanding their interactions with H2S/RSSH have only recently begun. In this Mini Review, some of the most recent discoveries of polysulfides within biological contexts are summarized and these include their biological formation pathways, detection methods for animal and plant samples, properties, and unique functions. These studies have set up a solid foundation for understanding polysulfide biology, and more mechanistic details are expected to be discovered in the coming years.
