Title: Metabolomics Analysis Reveals the Accumulation Patterns of Flavonoids and Volatile Compounds in &lt;i&gt;Camellia oleifera&lt;/i&gt; Petals with Different Color.

Abstract: To systematically and comprehensively investigate the metabolic characteristics of coloring substances and floral aroma substances in &lt;i&gt;Camellia oleifera&lt;/i&gt; petals with different colors, ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and headspace solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) metabolomics methods were applied to determine the metabolic profiles of white, candy-pink and dark-red petals. The results revealed that 270 volatile organic compounds were detected, mainly terpenoids, heterocyclic, esters, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and alcohols, in which phenylethyl alcohol, lilac alcohol, and butanoic acid, 1-methylhexyl ester, hotrienol, alpha-terpineol and 7-Octen-4-ol, 2-methyl-6-methylene-, (S)-, butanoic acid, 2-methyl-, 2-methylbutyl ester, 2,4-Octadienal, (E,E)- could act as the floral scent compounds. A total of 372 flavonoid compounds were identified, and luteolin, kaempferol, cyanidin and peonidin derivatives were considered as the main coloring substances for candy-pink and dark-red petal coloration. In conclusion, this study intuitively and quantitatively exhibited the variations in flower color and floral scent of &lt;i&gt;C. oleifera&lt;/i&gt; petal with different colors caused by changes in variations of flavonoids and volatile organic compound composition, and provided useful data for improving the sensory quality and breeding of &lt;i&gt;C. oleifera&lt;/i&gt; petals.
