Title: 1.20 Zintl chemistry: From zintl ions to zintl clusters

Abstract: Zintl chemistry is an aged and vital research topic in inorganic chemistry and attracts much more attention of inorganic and theoretical chemists as well as materials scientists. Its antiquity lies in durable research interests from 1890s to now; however, the thriving innovative potential in interdiscipline is the embodiment of its vitality. In the past two decades, Zintl chemistry has experienced an unprecedented renaissance as a result of many important breakthroughs in the synthetic methods, characterization techniques and quantum chemical calculations. This chapter will report systematically on the synthesis of related anions or clusters, which includes intermetalloid and heterometallic clusters as well as their derivatives functionalized with organic-group(s). We will also discuss the formation mechanisms of Zintl anions in solution by ex situ investigations (the characterization and even isolation of key intermediates) and quantum chemical investigations. Additionally, the chapter will shed light on the relationships between the electronic structures and topologies by some selected examples. Finally, some recent progress of material science using Zintl cluster as precursor will also be shown in the end of this chapter.
