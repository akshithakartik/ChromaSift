Title: Analysis of authorized coccidiostats in chicken feces and environmental water by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based on dispersive solid-phase extraction and lyophilization

Abstract: A simple, sensitive, and efficient method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was developed for the determination of 8 coccidiostats in chicken feces and environmental water (including sewage, pond water, and lake water) surrounding the farm. Target analytes in chicken feces were extracted with 2% acetic acid in acetonitrile solution, followed by a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) cleanup step using the mixture of PSA and C18 adsorbents. Environmental water samples were pretreated using a lyophilization approach. Analysis was carried out on a UPLC-MS/MS with the combination of methanol and 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution as the mobile phase under multiple reaction monitoring in positive and negative ionization modes. Results showed that 8 coccidiostats were linear with correlation coefficients higher than 0.99. Method validation was performed using fortified samples, reaching satisfactory recoveries of 75.9%–97.8% in chicken feces and 71.9%–108.2% in environmental water. Limits of detection for 8 analytes in chicken feces and environmental water were 0.03∼2 µg/kg and 0.005∼1 µg/L, respectively. Matrix effects were calculated and strong signal suppression (>50%) for some coccidiostats was observed. The developed method was successfully applied to analyze coccidiostats in chicken feces and environmental water collected from local chicken farms.
