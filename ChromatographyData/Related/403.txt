Title: Formalin Fixation Followed by Paraffin Embedding Allows Long-Term Storage of Proteins for Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis

Abstract: In an anatomical pathology laboratory, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is used to characterize amyloid deposits identified in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET). However, the development of additional tests is partially limited by the lack of information the passage of time has on the proteins in FFPET. To investigate the reliability of LC-MS/MS in the analysis of old FFPET specimens, 1 bone marrow aspirate clot was analyzed by LC-MS/MS yearly from 2014 to 2018, in 3 consecutive months. Peptide-spectrum match, number of peptides identified, and percentage of the proteins covered were the parameters collected for the hemoglobin subunits alpha (HbA), beta (HbB), delta (HbD), and gamma (HbG). These proteins are constant components of the peripheral blood and are present in high and low abundance, allowing the monitorization of the performance of the test across varying protein concentrations. The hemoglobin subunits were stable over the years studied; 71% to 74% of HbA, 77% to 80% of HbB, 69% to 77% of HbD, and 57% to 63% of HbG were covered, with no statistical difference between 2014 and 2018. The number of peptides identified was also constant, 11 to 13 for HbA, 13 to 15 for HbB, 11 to 14 for HbD, and 7 to 9 for HbG. Peptide spectrum match was only slightly more variable: 209 to 327 for HbA, 569 to 1052 for HbB, 286 to 533 HbD, and 142 to 292 for HbG. In conclusion, high abundance hemoglobins, HbA and HbB, and relatively low abundance ones, HbD and HbG, are preserved in FFPET and confidently identified by LC-MS/MS for at least 5 years.
