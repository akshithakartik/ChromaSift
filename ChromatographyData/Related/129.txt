Title: What about nitrogen? Using nitrogen as a carrier gas during the analysis of petroleum biomarkers by gas chromatography mass spectrometry

Abstract: Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) is a commonly used method for organic geochemistry for both academic research and applications such as petroleum analysis. Gas chromatography requires a carrier gas, which needs to be both volatile and stable and in most organic geochemical applications helium or hydrogen have been used, with helium predominating for gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Helium, however, is becoming an increasingly scarce resource and is not sustainable. Hydrogen is the most commonly considered alternative carrier gas to helium but has characteristics that in certain respects make its use less practical, foremost is that hydrogen is flammable and explosive. But as hydrogen is increasingly used as a fuel, higher demand may also make its use less desirable. Here we show that nitrogen can be used for the GC–MS analysis of fossil lipid biomarkers. Using nitrogen, chromatographic separation of isomers and homologues can be achieved, but sensitivity is orders of magnitude less than for helium. It is reasonable to use nitrogen as a carrier gas in applications where low levels of detection are not needed, such as the characterization of samples of crude oil or foodstuffs, or potentially as part of a gas-mixture seeking to reduce helium-demand but maintain a level of chromatographic separation sufficient to support proxy-based characterizations of petroleum.
