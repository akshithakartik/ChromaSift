Title: A simple and robust LC-ESI single quadrupole MS-based method to analyze polyphenols in plant extracts using deep eutectic solvents.

Abstract: Currently, the interest in polyphenols is increasing due to their significant properties in health. Polyphenols exist in a range of natural products, however their extraction as well as their characterization are important issues as they are mainly present in complex matrices. Therefore, sensitive and selective analytical methods based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry are essential. Nevertheless, access to such high-resolution techniques is quite rare. Thus, in this work we present a simple, selective and robust method based on a single-quadrupole (Q) MS technique) for the analysis of a wide range of polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids and anthocyanins. Specifically, we present:\xe2\x80\xa2A simple liquid chromatography electro-spray ionization (LC-ESI) single-quadrupole mass selective (MS) method for the analysis of 18 different polyphenols.\xe2\x80\xa2Application of the method to three plant-based extracts that are derived after green extraction methods.
