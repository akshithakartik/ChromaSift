Title: Green analytical chemistry as an integral part of sustainable education development

Abstract: Green chemistry is an important way of thinking in the field of chemistry and aims to conduct processes in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. It is the application of a wide range of principles that minimize the impact of both chemical processes and products on the environment. And what about analytical chemistry? There is no doubt that analytical chemistry plays an important role in the sustainable development of the planet. However, this only applies if analytical procedures are of high quality (sensitive, precise, and accurate) and also in line with the principles of environmental sustainability. This essay presents a brief discussion of the evolution of green chemistry and its multidimensional impacts, including the “industry” of analytical chemistry as well as academic education and research. We emphasize the difference between the term “sustainability” and “greenness.” Therefore, at least basic information on sustainability in analytical chemistry is provided. We hope that our considerations will inspire analytical chemists and will contribute to the further development of both green analytical chemistry and sustainable analytical chemistry.
