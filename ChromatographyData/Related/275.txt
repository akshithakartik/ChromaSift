Title: Supercritical fluid chromatography based on reversed-phase/ ion chromatography mixed-mode stationary phase for separation of spirooxindole alkaloids

Abstract: The present paper illustrates the versatility of the supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) since, for the first time, four spirooxindole alkaloids (SOAs) including two pairs of isomers were separated by using two types of reversed-phase/ ion chromatography (RP/IC) mixed-mode stationary phases. Two mixed-mode stationary phases (C8SAX and C8SCX) was simultaneously provided dispersive and electrostatic interactions, which were suitable for the separation of such alkaloids. This study tried to provide an in-depth understanding of the SFC separation mechanism of the mixed-mode stationary phase through investigation of the impact of changes in mobile phase composition on alkaloids’ retention behavior. On C8SAX, due to the strong electrostatic repulsion, there was a very narrow elution window of the alkaloids, of which behaviors were hardly affected by adding diethylamine in mobile phase. When adding formic acid or acidic ammonium formate, the prolonged retention time of alkaloids was presented because of the shielded effect of formate anions on the electrostatic repulsion. In particular, better peak shape and improved resolution were obtained by using acidic ammonium formate due to the deactivation of silanol groups by ammonium cations. On the other hand, both formic acid and acidic ammonium formate can strengthen the electrostatic attraction of C8SCX, causing difficult elution of the alkaloids. Ammonium cations from either the protonated diethylamine or the ionized ammonium formate, were considered as counter ions to effectively mask the electrostatic attraction of C8SCX, to significantly reduce the retention of alkaloids, but improve the resolution. Finally, utilizing two developed SFC methods, i.e., C8SAX with EtOH+ 10 mM acidic ammonium formate in CO2, or C8SCX with EtOH+0.1% diethylamine in CO2, the baseline separation of corynoxeine and isocorynoxeine, rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline was achieved within 5 min.
