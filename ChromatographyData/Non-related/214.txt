Title: Post-annealing of hematite films: The changes in surface chemistry, lattice dynamics, and photoelectrochemical properties

Abstract: This research deals with tracking changes in the surface chemistry and lattice dynamics of α-Fe2O3 (hematite) thin films upon post-annealing and its correlation with the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties. The hematite thin films were prepared by the electric field-assisted liquid phase deposition (EA-LPD) method. The as-prepared thin films were heated at three different heating rates: 10, 22, and 80 ℃/min to 350 ℃; and kept for 15 min and then quenched in the air. The structural characterizations showed that the post-annealing process induces oxygen vacancies and the formation of hydroxyl groups on the surface. The extent of the changes in the surface chemistry strongly depends on the heating rate. Such changes in the surface chemistry possess a synergic effect on the PEC properties. Here the post-annealed photoanodes with an 80 ℃/min heating rate showed significantly improved PEC activity and exhibited a maximum photocurrent density ⁓ 0.73 mA.cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, 2.5 times higher than that for pristine sample. The lattice dynamics investigations suggested that the as-prepared photoanodes are composed of α-FeOOH. Upon post-annealing, α-FeOOH was partially converted into a proto-hematite intermediate phase. The longitudinal optical (LO) modes for the post-annealed samples enhanced as an indicator for the development of lattice disorder, as the results of induced oxygen vacancy defects and hydroxyl groups on the surface.
