Title: Non-targeted and suspect screening analysis using ion exchange chromatography-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry reveals polar and very mobile xenobiotics in Danish drinking water

Abstract: Non-targeted and suspect screening analysis is gaining approval across the scientific and regulatory community to monitor the chemical status in the environment and thus environmental quality. These holistic screening analyses provides the means to perform suspect screening and go beyond to discover previously undescribed chemical pollutants in environmental samples. In a case study, we developed and optimized a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry platform hyphenated with anion exchange chromatography to screen drinking water samples in Denmark. The optimized non-targeted screening method was able to detect anionic and polar compounds and was successfully applied to drinking water from two drinking water facilities. Following a data analysis pipeline optimization, anionic pesticide residues and other environmental contaminants were detected at confidence identification level 1 such as dimethachlor ESA, mecoprop, and dichlorprop in drinking water. In addition to these three substances, it was possible to detect another 1662 compounds, of which 97 were annotated at confidence identification level 2. More research is urgently needed to health risk prioritize the detected substances and to determine their concentrations.
