Title: Effect of Natural Variation and Rootstock on Fruit Quality and Volatile Organic Compounds of \'&lt;i&gt;Kiyomi tangor&lt;/i&gt;\' (&lt;i&gt;Citrus reticulata&lt;/i&gt; Blanco) Citrus.

Abstract: In this study, we compared the fruit quality and color of \'Kiyomi\' (WT) and its mutant (MT) grafted on Ziyang xiangcheng (Cj) (WT/Cj, MT/Cj), and the MT grafted on Trifoliate orange (Pt) (MT/Pt). The differences in sugar, organic acid, flavonoids, phenols, and volatile substances of the three materials were also analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). The results showed significant differences in the appearance of WT/Cj, MT/Cj, and MT/Pt. MT/Pt, compared to WT/Cj, MT/Cj, had lower sugar, acid, phenol and flavonoid contents in the pulp. However, MT/Pt pulp was higher in vitamin C (V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;), and the peel had significantly higher total phenol and flavonoid contents. In terms of pulp, WT/Cj had the greatest diversity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 4-methyl-1-pentanol was significantly higher in MT/Cj pulp, while MT/Pt pulp had a unique octanoic acid, methyl ester. VOCs were more diverse in the peels of the three materials. \xce\xb2-Myrcene and valencen were significantly higher in MT/Cj peels. In contrast, 16 unique VOCs were detected in MT/Pt, and D-limonene content was significantly higher than in WT/Cj and MT/Cj. The results suggest Trifoliate orange is a suitable rootstock for MT.
