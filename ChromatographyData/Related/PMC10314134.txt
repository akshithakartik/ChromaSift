Title: Characterization of volatile metabolites in Pu-erh teas with different storage years by combining GC-E-Nose, GC-MS, and GC-IMS.

Abstract: Storage time is one of the important factors affecting the aroma quality of Pu-erh tea. In this study, the dynamic changes of volatile profiles of Pu-erh teas stored for different years were investigated by combining gas chromatography electronic nose (GC-E-Nose), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). GC-E-Nose combined with partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) realized the rapid discrimination of Pu-erh tea with different storage time (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Y\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.992, Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.968). There were 43 and 91 volatile compounds identified by GC-MS and GC-IMS, respectively. A satisfactory discrimination (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Y\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.991, and Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.966) was achieved by using PLS-DA based on the volatile fingerprints of GC-IMS. Moreover, according to the multivariate analysis of VIP\xc2\xa0&gt;\xc2\xa01.2 and univariate analysis of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;\xc2\xa0&lt;\xc2\xa00.05, 9 volatile components such as linalool and (E)-2-hexenal were selected as key variables to distinguish Pu-erh teas with different storage years. The results provide theoretical support for the quality control of Pu-erh tea.
