Title: Cation exchange chromatography membrane of Poly(ethylene vinyl alcohol) nanofiber/sulfonated polystyrene microsphere composite for lysozyme isolation

Abstract: Lysozyme, as widely used bacteriostatic enzyme, the rapid and low-cost isolation of lysozyme with high purity was the basis and premise of its application. In this work, a facile approach of spray coating was proposed to engineer composite membranes consisted of sulfonated polystyrene microspheres and poly(ethylene vinyl alcohol) nanofibers. The sulfonic acid groups offer strong interaction between the ligand and lysozyme, endowing high lysozyme adsorption capacity. And simultaneously, the porous channels of nanofibrous membranes guarantee high water flux. The FTIR and XPS results indicate the incorporation of sulfonated polystyrene spheres. The EVOH/SPS composite membranes exhibit both high water permeability and lysozyme adsorption capacity. Importantly, the constructed chromatography columns possess high performance of water flux with 9172 L h−1 m−2, and excellent adsorption capacity at static and dynamic state, revealing enormous potential for application.
