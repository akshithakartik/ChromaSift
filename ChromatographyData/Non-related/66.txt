Title: Thermodynamic models of solid-liquid-interface chemistry - free surfaces and charge regulation boundary conditions

Abstract: In this contribution, we provide an introduction into thermodynamic models of solid-liquid-interface chemistry for free surfaces as well as for surfaces interacting on the nanoscale, i.e. under charge regulation boundary conditions. The theoretical background of electrostatic surface complexation models is explained on the basis of a simple generic system. A more complex chemistry, involving trivalent cations (Eu3+) and a NaCl solution between two quartz surfaces highlights some strengths of the presented modeling approach, i.e. the capability to include complex solution- and surface chemistry, while still considering the full Poisson-Boltzmann equation for solving the surface electrostatic balance condition.
