Title: Preparation of Protein A Membrane Adsorbers Using Strain-Promoted, Copper-Free Dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-Azide Click Chemistry.

Abstract: Protein A chromatography is the preferred unit operation for purifying Fc-based proteins. Convective chromatography technologies, like membrane adsorbers, can perform the purification rapidly and improve throughput dramatically. While the literature reports the preparation of Protein A membrane adsorbers utilizing traditional coupling chemistries that target lysine or thiol groups on the Protein A ligand, this study demonstrates a new approach utilizing copper-free dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-azide click chemistry. The synthetic pathway consists of three main steps: bioconjugation of Protein A with a DBCO-polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker, preparation of an azide-functionalized membrane surface, and click reaction of DBCO-Protein A onto the membrane surface. Using polyclonal human immunoglobulins (hIgG) as the target molecule, Protein A membranes prepared by this synthetic pathway showed a flowrate-independent dynamic binding capacity of ~10 mg/mL membrane at 10% breakthrough. Fitting of static binding capacity measurements to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm showed a maximum binding (q&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 27.48 \xc2\xb1 1.31 mg/mL and an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) of value of 1.72 \xc3\x97 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; \xc2\xb1 4.03 \xc3\x97 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; mg/mL. This work represents a new application for copper-less click chemistry in the membrane chromatography space and outlines a synthetic pathway that can be followed for immobilization of other ligands.
