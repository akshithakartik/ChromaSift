Title: Development and validation of a high-performance thin layer chromatography method for the simultaneous determination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combinations in tablet dosage forms.

Abstract: A simple and sensitive high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was developed and validated as per the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for the simultaneous determination of amoxicillin (AMX) and clavulanic acid (CLA) combinations in tablet formulations. Chromatography was performed on precoated glass plates with normal phase silica gel 60 F&lt;sub&gt;254&lt;/sub&gt;. The mobile phase was acetone:ethyl acetate:glacial acetic acid:water (11:9:4:2 (v/v)). The plate was scanned at a wavelength of 428\xc2\xa0nm after derivatization with ninhydrin. The validation of the method revealed that the linearity range lies between 400 and 1200 ng/band for AMX and 100-300 ng/band for CLA, with coefficients of determination of 0.9997 and 0.9966, respectively. Recoveries in standard addition accuracy studies were 100.3 % for AMX and 96.75 % for CLA. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of the developed method are 20.3 ng/band and 61.6 ng/band for AMX and 18.5 ng/band and 56.2 ng/band for CLA, respectively. The new, novel high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) method that was successfully developed in this study was applied for the simultaneous determination of AMX and CLA in their fixed-dose tablet dosage forms obtained from retail pharmacies and offered comparable results with the official British Pharmacopoeial high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method.
