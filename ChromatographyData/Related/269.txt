Title: Development and evaluation of Pirkle-type chiral stationary phase for flash chromatography

Abstract: Liquid chromatography is the most applied methodology for enantioseparation in preparative and semi-preparative scale; however, flash chromatography is seldom the first choice. This work proposes a new sustainable method to achieve pure enantiomers in mg scale. Herein, the functionalization of silica for flash chromatography columns with a suitable chiral selector, for subsequent quantitative enantioseparation of chiral compounds, is described. Accordingly, the Whelk-OÂ®1 chiral selector was bonded to flash silica and packed into a reused solid phase extraction cartridge. For the evaluation of the enantioselective performance of the flash column, the enantiomers of a chiral derivative of xanthone were quantitatively enantioseparated with an average recovery of 70% and an enantiomer ratio (e.r.) of 99% and 97% for each enantiomer. Evaluation with the anti-inflammatory drug naproxen was also performed, resulting in an average recovery of 95% and 89% and 95% e.r. for each enantiomer. The flash column showed high stability and load ability, versatility, and good reproducibility.
