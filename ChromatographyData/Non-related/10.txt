Title: Supramolecular flow chemistry: Construction of multiscale supramolecular assemblies by micro/nanofluidic techniques

Abstract: The rapid and precise fabrication of multiscale supramolecular assemblies using micro/nanofluidic techniques has emerged as a dynamic area of research in supramolecular chemistry, materials chemistry, and organic chemistry. This review summarizes the application of micro/nanofluidic techniques in constructing supramolecular assemblies, including nanoscale supramolecular assemblies such as macrocycles and cages, microscale supramolecular assemblies such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and macroscale supramolecular assemblies such as supramolecular hydrogels. Compared to conventional synthesis methods, micro/nanofluidic techniques for the production of supramolecular assemblies have significant advantages, including enhanced safety, high reaction rates, improved selectivity/yield, and scalability. Additionally, micro/nanofluidic systems facilitate the creation of precisely controllable micro/nanoconfined environments, allowing for a unique flow behavior that improves our understanding of the supramolecular self-assembly process. Such systems may also lead to the development of novel supramolecular assemblies that differ from those generated via traditional methods.
