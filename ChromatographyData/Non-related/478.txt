Title: 15.10 Organometallic Chemistry of Drugs Based on Technetium and Rhenium

Abstract: This section reviews progress in bioorganometallic chemistry with rhenium and technetium over the past two decades. It includes general considerations with respect to the concepts for which the compounds of the two elements described here are designed. The more specific subsections focus on the traditional field of receptor targeting with 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals and molecular imaging agents. More recently, non-radioactive, de novo rhenium complexes have emerged as versatile tools for various applications in life sciences. Progress in this respect is discussed for rhenium alone or in combination with 99mTc homologs where applicable. Some urgent disease targets such as Alzheimer's disease are given special attention. Future directions, incentives for research, are reviewed throughout. The objective of this section is to not only provide a comprehensive review on organometallic chemistry of rhenium and technetium in the life sciences, but also to give a scope for the field based on recent accomplishments.
