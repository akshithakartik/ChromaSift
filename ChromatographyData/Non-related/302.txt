Title: On the directions of carbon surface modifications towards efficient PFOS removal: Analyzing the interplay of porosity and surface chemistry

Abstract: Commercial activated carbon (BAX) and high porosity carbon black (BP) were modified to elucidate the effect of surface chemistry on adsorption of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS); the surface of initial BAX was thermally reduced (BAX-HT) and on BP melamine was either deposited or used as source of N-groups incorporated to the carbon matrix (BP-M and BP-M-HT). These modifications also affected porosity and had a strong effect on the PFOS adsorption mechanism. While on BAX-HT ultramicropores attracted PFOS via dispersive interactions with their hydrophobic surface, on the initial BAX phenols in larger pores also played a role in the monolayer formation. On BP-M and BP-M-HT, NH2 groups immobilized a first layer of PFOS in mesopores through electrostatic interactions. Besides, the PFOS molecules were also deposited in hydrophobic micropores. The thermal decomposition of melamine led to the incorporation of nitrogen groups to the BP-M-HT surface and increased the volume of ultramicropores. Even though these features increased PFOS adsorption in monolayer, an increase in the volume of ultramicropores did not compensate for a decrease on the amount of amine groups directly attracting PFOS. The results indicated that positively charged centers located in mesopores of high volumes are the most important features granting high adsorption capacity of carbons for PFOS removal.
