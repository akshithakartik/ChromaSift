Title: A Prussian-blue analogue (PBA) ion-chromatography-based technique for selective separation of Rb+ (as RbCl) from brines

Abstract: A new general method is presented for separating pure RbCl(s) from solutions rich in Na+ and K+. The method relies on Rb+ adsorption via ion exchange performed by self-synthesized PES coated Zn-Hexa-Cyanoferrate material. The procedure starts by passing the wastewater through an ion exchange column, which is thereafter regenerated with 1 M NH4Cl. If the Rb+ absorbed on the column does not reach a minimal predetermined value (e.g., 8%, eq-based), the ammonia is removed by sublimation and the remaining salts are passed again through a Na+-preadsorbed column. Once the adsorbed Rb+ is substantial (>8%), a chromatography-based separation between Rb+ and Na+/K+ is performed, using a 2nd column, fully pre-adsorbed with NH4
                     +. First, 0.05M NH4
                     +-solution is used to extract Na+ and K+ out of the first column, along with a small Rb+ mass, which is thereafter partly re-adsorbed on the second column, while Na+/K+ ions are not. Once the exiting eluent solution is devoid of the competing ions, 1M NH4
                     +-solution is used to extract all the remaining Rb+ into the regeneration solution, which is thereafter subjected to water evaporation followed by NH3/HCl sublimation to result in pure RbCl(s) product. The paper used theoretical simulations corroborated by empirical results to present proof of concept for the suggested approach. A detailed cost analysis (Capex and Opex) reveals that the RbCl(s) production cost does not exceed âˆ¼25% of the current salt price.
