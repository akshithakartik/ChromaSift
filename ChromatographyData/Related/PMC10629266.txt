Title: Untargeted Metabolomic Study of Lung Cancer Patients after Surgery with Curative Intent.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is a leading cause of mortality, claiming more than 1.8 million deaths per year worldwide. Surgery is one of the most effective treatments when the disease is in its early stages. The study of metabolic alterations after surgical intervention with curative intent could be used to assess the response to treatment or the detection of cancer recurrence. In this study, we have evaluated the metabolomic profile of serum samples (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 110) from preoperative (PRE) and postoperative (POST) LC patients collected at two different time points (1 month, A; 3-6 months, B) with respect to healthy people. An untargeted metabolomic platform based on reversed phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS), was applied (MassIVE ID MSV000092213). Twenty-two altered metabolites were annotated by comparing all the different studied groups. DG(14,0/22:1), stearamide, proline, and E,e-carotene-3,3\'-dione were found altered in PRE, and their levels returned to those of a baseline control group 3-6 months after surgery. Furthermore, 3-galactosyllactose levels remained altered after intervention in some patients. This study provides unique insights into the metabolic profiles of LC patients after surgery at two different time points by combining complementary analytical methods.
