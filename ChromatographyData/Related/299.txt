Title: The use of gas chromatography combined with chemical and sensory analysis to evaluate nuisance odours in the air and water environment

Abstract: Varieties of gas chromatography (GC) combined with chemical detection (CD) and sensory analysis at the odour detection port (ODP) for the evaluation of environmental odorants has steadily increased in application and sophistication; this has given rise to a plethora of techniques that cater to specific tasks. With this diversity of approaches in mind, there is a need to assess the critical points at which these approaches differ, as well as likely risks and factors that may affect them. These critical points explained within this review include sample preparation, GC separation techniques (with associated co-elution risks), how the elute is separated between CD and sensory analysis, the type of CD, the type of sensory analysis (with particular attention paid to its factors and guidelines), integrative data techniques, as well as how that data may be used. Additionally, this review provides commentary on the current state of the research space and makes recommendations based on how these analyses should be reported, the standardisation of nomenclature, as well as the impediments to the future goals of this research area. By careful consideration of the critical points of varying analytical processes and how best to communicate these findings, the quality of output within this area will improve. This review provides a benchmark for how GC-CD/sensory analysis should be undertaken and reported.
