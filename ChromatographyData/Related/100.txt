Title: Multiple heart-cutting two-dimensional liquid chromatography/charged aerosol detector assay of ginsenosides for quality evaluation of ginseng from diverse Chinese patent medicines

Abstract: For quality control of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) containing the same herbal medicine or different herbal medicines that have similar chemical composition, current ″one standard for one species″ research mode leads to poor universality of the analytical approaches unfavorable to discriminate easily confused species. Herein, we were aimed to elaborate a multiple heart-cutting two-dimensional liquid chromatography/charged aerosol detector (MHC-2DLC/CAD) approach to quantitatively assess ginseng from multiple CPMs. Targeting baseline resolution of 16 ginsenosides (noto-R1/Rg1/Re/Rf/Ra2/Rb1/Rc/Ro/Rb2/Rb3/Rd/Rh1/Rg2/Rg3/Rg3(R)/24(R)-p-F11), experiments were conducted to optimize key parameters and validate its performance. A Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column and an XBridge Shield RP18 column were separately utilized in the first-dimensional (1D) and the second-dimensional (2D) chromatography. Eight consecutive cuttings could achieve good separation of 16 ginsenosides within 85 min. The developed MHC-2DLC/CAD method showed good linearity (R
                     2 > 0.999), repeatability (RSD < 6.73%), stability (RSD < 5.63%), inter- and intra-day precision (RSD < 5.57%), recovery (93.76–111.14%), and the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) varied between 0.45–2.37 ng and 0.96–4.71 ng, respectively. We applied it to the content determination of 16 ginsenosides simultaneously from 28 different ginseng-containing CPMs, which unveiled the ginsenoside content difference among the tested CPMs, and gave useful information to discriminate ginseng in the preparation samples, as well. The MHC-2DLC/CAD approach exhibited advantages of high specificity, good separation ability, and relative high analysis efficiency, which also justified the feasibility of our proposed ″Monomethod Characterization of Structure Analogs″ strategy in quality evaluation of diverse CPMs that contained different ginseng.
