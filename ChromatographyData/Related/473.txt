Title: Inline-tandem purification of viruses from cell lysate by agarose-based chromatography

Abstract: An efficient chromatography-based virus purification method has been developed and validated for the non-pathogenic infectious virus PRD1. Compared to the conventional method that consists of relatively time-consuming and labour-intensive precipitation and density gradient ultracentrifugation steps, the method developed here is performed in a single flow using tandem-coupled anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography (AIEX-SEC) columns. This inline approach helps to minimize the loss of virus in the process and streamlines time consumption, since no physical transfer of the sample is required between purification steps. In the development process, sample feed composition, dynamic binding capacity and elution conditions for the AIEX resin as well as different exclusion limits for SEC resins were optimized to achieve maximal yield of pure infectious viruses. Utilizing this new approach, a high-quality virus sample was produced from a lysate feed in 320 min with a total yield of 13 mg purified particles per litre of cell lysate, constituting a 3.5-fold yield increase as compared to the conventional method, without compromising the high specific infectivity of the product (6 × 1012 to 7 × 1012 pfu/mg of protein). The yield of infectious viruses of the lysate feed was 54%. The easy scalability of chromatography-based methods provide a direct route to industrial usage without any significant changes needed to be made to the purification regime. This is especially interesting as the method has high potential to be used for purification of various viruses and nanoparticles, including adenovirus.
