Title: Nano-sized stationary phase packings retained by single-particle frit for microchip liquid chromatography

Abstract: Modern chromatography is increasingly focused on miniaturization and integration. Compared to conventional liquid chromatography, microfluidic chip liquid chromatography (microchip-LC) has the potential due to its zero-dead volume connection and ease of integration. Nano-sized packings have the potential to significantly enhance separation performance in microchip-LC. However, their application has been hindered by packing difficulties. This study presents a method for packing nano-sized silica particles into a microchannel as the stationary phase. The microchip-LC packed column was prepared by combining the weir and the porous silica single-particle as frit to retain the packing particles. A surface tension-based single-particle picking technique was established to insert porous single-particle frit into glass microchannels. Additionally, we developed a slurry packing method that utilizes air pressure to inject nano-sized packing into the microchannel. Pressure-driven chromatographic separation was performed using this nano-packed column integrated into a glass microchip. The mixture of four PAHs was successfully separated within just 8 minutes using a 5 mm separation channel length, achieving high theoretical plates (106 plates/m). Overall, these findings demonstrate the potential of utilizing nano-sized packings for enhancing chromatographic performance in microchip systems.
