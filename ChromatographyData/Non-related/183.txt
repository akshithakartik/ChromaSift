Title: Architecture design of MXene-based materials for sodium-chemistry based batteries

Abstract: Sodium-chemistry based batteries with high theoretical capacity, high energy density, and low cost have caught tremendous attention for replacing traditional lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, sodium-chemistry based batteries suffer numerous pressing issues, including high chemical activity, sluggish reaction kinetics, dissolution/shuttling of intermediates, and severe sodium metal dendrite growth, which severely restricts their development and further commercialization. MXene are considered as promising candidates for resolving these above problems due to their superior intrinsic properties including two-dimensional (2D) morphology, mechanical flexibility, excellent electrical conductivity, tunable surface characteristics, and large surface area. This review summarizes the recent progress on sodium-chemistry based batteries using MXene architectures, discussing the synthesis approaches of MXene materials and working principles of various sodium-chemistry based batteries. Then, several typical cases of sodium-chemistry based batteries are analyzed based on representative works from the viewpoints of design concepts, fabrication approaches, engineering strategies, structural and composition tuning, specific functions of diverse MXenes, and electrochemical performance. Lastly, the remaining challenges/issues and future prospects of sodium-chemistry based batteries are presented and discussed. It is believed that this review may provide new insights for the development of MXene architectures and their practical utilization in sodium-chemistry based energy storage devices.
