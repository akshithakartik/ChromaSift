Title: Microchip gas chromatography column using magnetic beads coated with polydimethylsiloxane and metal organic frameworks

Abstract: Micro gas chromatography (μGC) using microfabricated silicon columns has been developed in response to the requirement for portable on-site gas analysis. Although different stationary phases have been developed, repeatable and reliable surface coatings in these rather small microcolumns remains a challenge. Herein, a new stationary phase coating strategy using magnetic beads (MBs) as carriers for micro column is presented. MBs modified with organopolysiloxane (MBs@OV-1) and a metal organic framework (MBs@HKUST-1) are deposited in on-chip microcolumns assisted with a magnetic field with an optimized modification process. MBs@OV-1 column showed a minimum HETP of 0.074 cm (1351 plates/m) of 62 cm/s. Mixtures of volatile organic compounds are successfully separated using MBs carried stationary phase which demonstrates that this technique has good chromatographic column efficiency. This method not only provides a novel coating process, washing and characterization of the stationary phases but also establishes a straightforward strategy for testing new absorbent materials for μGC systems.
