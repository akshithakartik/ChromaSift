Title: Recent advances in augmenting Fenton chemistry of nanoplatforms for enhanced chemodynamic therapy

Abstract: The past few years have witnessed the rise of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) as an emerging strategy for malignant tumors suppression. Nanoplatform-based CDT has great potential due to its highly effective, non-invasive and independent on external energy input. Nevertheless, it is still far from practical use in clinic due to its suboptimal efficacy. Considering that chemodynamic agents promote hydroxyl free radicals (OH) generation through Fenton/Fenton-like reaction in response to tumor microenvironment (TME) is the core of CDT, significant efforts have been devoted to studying enhanced CDT (ECDT) by manipulating intratumoral Fenton chemistry. In this review, the strategies to improve nanoplatform-based CDT efficacy are categorized and systematically introduced. As highlighted, these strategies can also be integrated into CDT-related combination therapy for therapeutic efficiency enhancement. Therefore, from basic principles, CDT-related synergistic therapies with the introduction of various external energy fields as auxiliary modalities are also discussed. Besides, current challenges and prospective developments of ECDT are reviewed. This review is expected to provide inspiration for further improving CDT efficiency to achieve more precise and efficient cancer therapy, and also promote more in-depth researches on nanoplatform-based chemodynamic cancer therapy to facilitate clinical translation.
