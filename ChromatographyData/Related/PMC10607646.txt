Title: Development and Validation of LC-MS/MS Method for Determination of Cytisine in Human Serum and Saliva.

Abstract: Cytisine (CYT) is a quinolizidine alkaloid used for nicotine addiction treatment. Recent clinical trial data regarding cytisine confirm its high effectiveness and safety as a smoking cessation treatment. CYT\'s popularity is growing due to its increased availability and licensing in more countries worldwide. This increased use by smokers has also resulted in an urgent need for continued drug research, including developing appropriate analytical methods for analyzing the drug in biological samples. In this study, a simple, fast, and reliable method combining hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (HILIC/ESI-QTOF-MS) for the determination of CYT in human serum and saliva was developed and validated. This was undertaken after the previous pre-treatment of the sample using solid-phase extraction (SPE). A hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column with a silica stationary phase was used for chromatographic analysis. In a linear gradient, the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile (ACN) and formate buffer at pH 4.0. The proposed method was fully validated and demonstrated its sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and accuracy. The method was successfully applied to determine CYT in serum and, for the first time, in saliva. The findings indicate that saliva could be a promising non-invasive alternative to measure the free concentration of CYT.
