Title: Purification of phage for therapeutic applications using high throughput anion exchange membrane chromatography

Abstract: As cases of multidrug resistant bacterial infections increase, scientists and clinicians around the world are increasingly turning to bacteriophages as alternatives to antibiotics. Even though our understanding of phage has increased significantly since the early days of its discovery, over a century ago, the currently used tools and technologies for phage purification for therapeutic applications are severely limited. Bacteriophages are produced by bacterial cultures, and impurities such as endotoxins must therefore be removed before clinical use. We present an anion exchange bind-and-elute membrane chromatographic method for purifying T7 bacteriophage from Escherichia coli culture supernatant that removes undesirable impurities, while ensuring a high viable phage count in the purified product. Our method does not involve the use of chemicals such as organic solvents and caesium chloride that could typically leave residual toxicity in the final product. It also does not require expensive equipment, such as an ultracentrifuge. Using our method, that is based on an in-house designed membrane module, 65% of viable T7 phage was recovered, and up to 94% endotoxins could be removed. The method, which took approximately 15Â min, is rapid and scalable, and produces quite pure bacteriophage samples in a single step. It therefore potentially represents a major improvement over the status quo, and shows the way ahead for streamlining phage manufacturing for therapeutic use.
