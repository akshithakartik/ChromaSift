Title: Microfluidic paper and thread-based separations: Chromatography and electrophoresis

Abstract: Paper and thread are widely used as the substrates for fabricating low-cost, disposable, and portable microfluidic analytical devices used in clinical, environmental, and food safety monitoring. Concerning separation methods including chromatography and electrophoresis, these substrates provide unique platforms for developing portable devices. This review focuses on summarizing recent research on the miniaturization of the separation techniques using paper and thread. Preconcentration, purification, desalination, and separation of various analytes are achievable using electrophoresis and chromatography methods integrated with modified or unmodified paper/thread wicking channels. A variety of 2D and 3D designs of paper/thread platforms for zone electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, and modified/unmodified chromatography are discussed with emphasis on their limitation and improvements. The current progress in the signal amplification strategies such as isoelectric focusing, isotachophoresis, ion concentration polarization, isoelectric focusing, and stacking methods in paper-based devices are reviewed. Different strategies for chromatographic separations based on paper/thread will be explained. The separation of target species from complex samples and their determination by integration with other analytical methods like spectroscopy and electrochemistry are well-listed. Furthermore, the innovations for plasma and cell separation from blood as an important human biofluid are presented, and the related paper/thread modification methods are explored.
