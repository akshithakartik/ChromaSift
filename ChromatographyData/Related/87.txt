Title: Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem high-resolution elevated mass spectrometry profiling of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus metabolites from the endophytic bacteria collected from the weeds of a previous dumpsite

Abstract: The culturable endophytic bacteria from the weeds Cleome rutidosperma of the family Cleomaceae and Digitaria sanguinalis of the family Poaceae obtained from a previous dumpsite in Pampanga, Philippines have been assessed for their anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity, and the analytes with such activity should be identified. However, due to the limited amounts collected from the isolation process, 1.8 mg yield of compound 1 from the endophyte of C. rutidosperma and 1.2 mg of a mixture from the endophyte of D. sanguinalis were selected for LC-MSE analysis. The production of compounds from the culturable endophytic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa— determined by gene-sequencing, an untargeted and data-independent analysis (DIA) by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution-elevated energy mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-MSE) technique was employed to profile the metabolites present in the two high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractions. The analytes present from P. aeruginosa detected by UHPLC-HR-MSE isolated from C. rutidosperma was phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (1), and for D. sanguinalis were chamigrenal (2), dialkyl resorcinol (3), and a pyoverdine elicitor (4). This study proves that UHPLC-HR-MSE could identify the anti-MRSA constituents in P. aeruginosa from commensal weeds C. rutidosperma and D. sanguinalis. The UHPLC-HR-MSE could help strengthen metabolomics antibacterial research and its related applications from a future perspective. Application of metabolomics research using UHPLC-HR-MSE could enhance the rehabilitation of dumpsites by the microbial community present.
