Title: Thin layer chromatography coupled with surface enhanced Raman scattering for rapid separation and on-site detection of multi-components

Abstract: The separation and detection of multi-component mixtures has always been a challenging task. Traditional detection methods often suffer from complex operation, high cost, and low sensitivity. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique is a high sensitivity, powerful and rapid detection tool, which can realize the specific detection of single substance components, but it must solve the problem that multi-component mixtures cannot be accurately determined. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) technology, as a high-throughput separation technology, uses chromatographic plate as the stationary phase, and could select different developing phases for separation experiments. The advantages of TLC technology in short distance and rapid separation are widely used in protein, dye and biomedical fields. However, TLC technology has limitations in detection ability and difficulty in obtaining ideal signal intensity. The combination of TLC technology and SERS technology made the operation procedure simple and the sample size small, which can achieve rapid on-site separation and quantitative detection of mixtures. Due to the rapid development of TLC-SERS technology, it has been widely used in the investigation of various complex systems. This paper reviews the application of TLC-SERS technology in food science, environmental pollution and biomedicine.
