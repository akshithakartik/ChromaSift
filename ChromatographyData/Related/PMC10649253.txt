Title: A Recombinant Alginate Lyase Algt1 with Potential in Preparing Alginate Oligosaccharides at High-Concentration Substrate.

Abstract: Alginate lyase has been demonstrated as an efficient tool in the preparation of functional oligosaccharides (AOS) from alginate. The high viscosity resulting from the high concentration of alginate poses a limiting factor affecting enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the preparation of the fragments with low degrees of polymerization (DP). Herein, a PL7 family alginate lyase Algt from &lt;i&gt;Microbulbifer thermotolerans&lt;/i&gt; DSM 19189 was developed and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt;. The recombinant alginate lyase Algt1 was constructed by adopting the structural domain truncation strategy, and the enzymatic activity towards the alginate was improved from 53.9 U/mg to 212.86 U/mg compared to Algt. Algt1 was stable when incubated at 40 \xc2\xb0C for 90 min, remaining with approximately 80.9% of initial activity. The analyses of thin-layer chromatography (TLC), fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) demonstrated that the DP of the minimum identifiable substrate of Algt1 was five, and the main hydrolysis products were AOS with DP 1-4. Additionally, 1-L the enzymatic hydrolysis system demonstrated that Algt1 exhibited an effective degradation at alginate concentrations of up to 20%, with the resulting products of monosaccharides (14.02%), disaccharides (21.10%), trisaccharides (37.08%), and tetrasaccharides (27.80%). These superior properties of Algt1 make it possible to efficiently generate functional AOS with low DP in industrial processing.
