Title: 4.01 Introduction: Solid state inorganic chemistry

Abstract: In a broad sense the field of inorganic chemistry can be broken down into substances based on molecules and those that are based on extended arrays linked by metallic, covalent, polar covalent, or ionic bonds. The field of solid state inorganic chemistry is largely concerned with elements and compounds that fall into the latter group. As a general rule, the electrical, optical, magnetic and structural properties of extended solids differ in important aspects from those of molecular solids. The extended nature of the bonding is much more amenable to achieving electronic properties such as metallic conductivity or superconductivity that are essential for many modern and not so modern applications. Long range magnetic ordering can be sustained to temperatures that enable practical applications. The direction and orientation of electric dipole moments can be organized so as to enable technologically important properties like piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity. Thatâ€™s not to say that examples of superconductivity, magnetism, or ferroelectricity cannot be achieved in molecular solids, but it is fair to say that it to do so is to take the hard road. This volume contains 19 chapters that provide an in depth look at the synthesis, crystal structures, properties and applications of a wide variety of solid state inorganic materials.
