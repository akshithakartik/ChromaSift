Title: Resolution limits of size exclusion chromatography columns identified from flow reversal and overcome by recycling liquid chromatography to improve the characterization of manufactured monoclonal antibodies

Abstract: The flow reversal (FR) technique consists of reversing the flow direction along a chromatographic column. It is used to reveal the origin (such as poor column packing, active sites, or slow absorption/escape kinetics) for the resolution limit of 4.6 mm × 150 mm long columns packed with 1.7 μm 200 Å Bridge-Ethylene-Hybrid (BEH

These columns are used to separate manufactured monoclonal antibodies (mAb, ∼ 150 kDa) from their close impurities (or IdeS fragments, ∼ 100 kDa) by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). FR unambiguously demonstrates that the resolution limit of these SEC columns is primarily due to long-range flow velocity biases covering distances of at least 500 μm across the column diameter. This confirms the existence of center-to-wall flow heterogeneities which cause undesirable tailing for the mAb peak. Because the transverse dispersion coefficient (

For the very same residence time in the column, the column efficiency is found to increase by +85% relative to that observed under conventional elution mode. The observed peak tailing of the mAb and its sub-units is not caused by active surface sites or by slow absorption/escape from the BEH Particles. Therefore, the most critical mAb impurities (hydrolytic degradation
