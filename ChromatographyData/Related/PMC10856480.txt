Title: &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. G2112 Detoxifies Phenazine-1-carboxylic Acid by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;5 Glucosylation.

Abstract: Microbial symbionts of plants constitute promising sources of biocontrol organisms to fight plant pathogens. &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. G2112 and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. G124 isolated from cucumber (&lt;i&gt;Cucumis sativus&lt;/i&gt;) leaves inhibited the plant pathogens &lt;i&gt;Erwinia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt;. When &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. G2112 and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. G124 were co-cultivated, a red halo appeared around &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. G2112 colonies. Metabolite profiling using liquid chromatography coupled to UV and mass spectrometry revealed that the antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) released by &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. G124 was transformed by &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. G2112 to red pigments. In the presence of PCA (&gt;40 \xc2\xb5g/mL), &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. G2112 could not grow. However, already-grown &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. G2112 (OD&lt;sub&gt;600&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1.0) survived PCA treatment, converting it to red pigments. These pigments were purified by reverse-phase chromatography, and identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry, NMR, and chemical degradation as unprecedented 5&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylated phenazine derivatives: 7-imino-5&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(1\'\xce\xb2-D-glucopyranosyl)-5,7-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid and 3-imino-5&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(1\'\xce\xb2-D-glucopyranosyl)-3,5-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid. 3-imino-5&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(1\'\xce\xb2-D-glucopyranosyl)-3,5-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid did not inhibit &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. G2112, proving that the observed modification constitutes a resistance mechanism. The coexistence of microorganisms-especially under natural/field conditions-calls for such adaptations, such as PCA inactivation, but these can weaken the potential of the producing organism against pathogens and should be considered during the development of biocontrol strategies.
