Title: Customizing multiple superlyophobic surfaces in water-oil-air systems: From controllable preparation to smart switching via manipulating heterogeneous surface chemistry

Abstract: Superlyophobicity that is being subdivided to multiple extreme wetting states has unique superiority in a specific interfacial application. Controllable preparation and smart switching of multiple superlyophobic surfaces are significant but remain a challenge. Here a flexible bilayer strategy is presented to construct three kinds of multiple superlyophobic surfaces with controllable extreme wetting behaviors of water and oil droplets in air while ultimately showing underoil superhydrophobicity and underwater superoleophobicity. A robust hydrophobic polyacrylate adhesive can be used expediently to adjust the heterogeneous surface chemistry resulting from extremely-low-surface-energy CF chain and water-loving TiO2 sol. Moreover, solvent-triggered process and ultraviolet irradiation enable smart switching among these fine superwetting states. Under the stimuli, the heterogeneous surface chemistry is further regulated by reconstruction of the bilayer components. Utilizing the superhydrophobic and underwater superoleophobic properties, the smart membrane realizes effective on-demand emulsion separation. This study provides an approach to customize smart surfaces with switchable superwettability among subdivided multiple superlyophobicity.
