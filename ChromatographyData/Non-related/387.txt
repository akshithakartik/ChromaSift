Title: Recycling methods for different cathode chemistries â€“ A critical review

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been gathering increasing attention worldwide as they are being widely used in portable devices and implemented in electric vehicles. With the increasing volume of LIBs poured into the market, the recycling of LIBs is becoming essential because the elements being currently used in LIBs, such as, Li and Co, have limited deposits in the world. In this paper, various recycling approaches, which are now prevalent or have the potential to become dominant in the near future are reviewed. Recycled materials reuse performance is included to exhibit the feasibility of these recycling technologies. Furthermore, emerging cathode chemistries are also introduced and possible recycling strategies for them are discussed.
