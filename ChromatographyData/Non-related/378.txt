Title: Special issue and perspective on the chemistry and physics of carbonaceous particle formation

Abstract: Carbonaceous particles formed during the partial oxidation of a fuel constitute a primary pollutant (i.e., soot) impacting human health and the environment. The competing soot formation and oxidation pathways associated with fossil fuels and carbon-containing renewable fuels must be understood to support the development of energy-conversion devices that limit health and environmental impacts. Such knowledge is also helpful in optimizing the properties of carbon black and other carbonaceous materials used in major industrial manufacturing processes, such as graphene, nanotubes, and (functional) carbon-coated nanoparticles. The current Special Issue comprises 16 articles that highlight progress relevant to carbonaceous particles.
