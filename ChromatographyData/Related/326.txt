Title: Opportunities and challenges of high-pressure ion exchange chromatography for nuclide separation and enrichment

Abstract: With the rapid development of the nuclear industry, more-stringent requirements are proposed for high-level radioactive waste liquid treatment and the enrichment of isotope products. High-pressure ion exchange chromatography has been widely accepted for the fine separation of elements and nuclides due to its advantages, such as high efficiency, environmental friendliness, ease of operation, and feasibility for large-scale industrial applications. Here, we summarized the evolution of high-pressure ion exchange chromatography and the relevant research progress in ion exchange equilibrium and related separation technology. The prospects for application of high-pressure ion exchange chromatography to rare earth elements, actinide elements and isotope separation were discussed. High-pressure ion exchange chromatography represents a promising strategy for the extraction of rare earth elements and actinide elements from high-level radioactive waste liquid, as well as being an effective method for the automated production of high purity isotope products with great environmental benefits.
