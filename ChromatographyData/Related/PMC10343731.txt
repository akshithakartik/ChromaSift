Title: Profiling and Isolation of Ten Rare Branched-Chain Alkylresorcinols in Quinoa.

Abstract: Alkylresorcinols (\xe2\x88\x91ARs) are bioactive lipid compounds predominantly found in cereals. These amphiphilic compounds exist in a high structural diversity and can be divided into two main groups, i.e., 5-alkylresorcinols (ARs) and 2-methyl-5-alkylresorcinols (mARs). The pseudocereal quinoa has a very unique AR profile, consisting not only of straight-chain alkyl chains but also &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;anteiso&lt;/i&gt;-branched isomers. Here, we describe a method for the isolation of such methyl-branched ARs and mARs from quinoa. The enrichment of the \xe2\x88\x91AR fraction from the lipid extracts by centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) was followed by \xe2\x88\x91AR profiling using countercurrent chromatography (CCC) and GC/MS analysis of CCC fractions. A total of 112 \xe2\x88\x91ARs could be detected, 63 of which had not been previously described in quinoa. Due to this high number of \xe2\x88\x91ARs, the direct isolation of individual ARs was not possible using conventional CCC. Instead, the more powerful heart-cut mode was applied to enrich the target compounds. A final purification step-the separation of CCC-co-eluting mARs from ARs -was performed via silver ion chromatography. Altogether, ten rare branched-chain \xe2\x88\x91ARs (five &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-branched mARs and five &lt;i&gt;anteiso&lt;/i&gt;-branched ARs, including mAR19:0-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; and AR20:0-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) were isolated with purities up to 98% in the double-digit mg range.
