Title: An overview of the current progress in green analytical chemistry by evaluating recent studies using greenness assessment tools

Abstract: Green chemistry principles have become increasingly important in various disciplines of chemistry, including analytical chemistry. This is mainly due to an ongoing awareness of the state of the ecosystem and the negative impacts that analytical procedures can have on the environment. The most important approach developed to address this issue is Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC). GAC is an environmental-friendly approach to analytical chemistry that aims to minimize the negative impact of analytical techniques on the environment and human health. This review provided a comprehensive overview of the history of GAC and the existing greenness assessment metric tools. The various approaches, such as the National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), Eco-scale Assessment (ESA), Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI), and Analytical Greens (AGREE) used to evaluate Green profiles were discussed in detail, and their importance in analytical approaches was examined. In addition, research articles on the applicability of assessment tools were discussed in detail in terms of greenness metrics. This review aims to provide researchers with comprehensive information on the various greenness assessment tools and their currently available applications.
