Title: An online preparative high-performance liquid chromatography system with enrichment and purification modes for the efficient and systematic separation of Panax notoginseng saponins

Abstract: In this study, an online preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC) system based on the combination of the enrichment and purification modes for the efficient and systematic separation of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) was achieved. Five separation columns were used for the first and second separation of target components, eighteen trap columns were used to capture the effluents from the first separation or loading the trapped sample effluents, and a two-position eight-port valve was used to switch between the first and second separations. The conditions for the first and second separation of PNS were simulated and optimized with the online prep-HPLC system. Then, the PNS were separated using optimized chromatographic conditions. Notably, 14 monomer compounds with >90% purity (11 compounds with purity >97%) were simultaneously isolated from PNS using the above self-developed device, and their chemical structures were identified. Moreover, the separation time was less than 33.0 h. After 6 repeated enrichment and purification, the weight of each compound obtained was more than 5.0 mg, with compound 2 weighing over 900 mg. In brief, the self-developed prep-HPLC system, which integrated enrichment and purification, is suitable for the efficient and systematic separation of PNS and has broad application prospects, especially for the separation of complex chemical components in natural products.
