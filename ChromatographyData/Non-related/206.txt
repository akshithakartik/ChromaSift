Title: Heterogeneous chemistry of ozone with floor cleaning agent: Implications of secondary VOCs in the indoor environment

Abstract: Human daily activities such as cooking, and cleaning can affect the indoor air quality by releasing primary emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as by the secondary product compounds formed through reactions with ozone (O3) and hydroxyl radicals (OH). However, our knowledge about the formation processes of the secondary VOCs is still incomplete. We performed real-time measurements of primary VOCs released by commercial floor-cleaning detergent and the secondary product compounds formed by heterogeneous reaction of O3 with the constituents of the cleaning agent by use of high-resolution mass spectrometry. We measured the uptake coefficients of O3 on the cleaning detergent at different relative humidities in dark and under different light intensities (320 nm < Î» < 400 nm) relevant for the indoor environment. On the basis of the detected compounds we developed tentative reaction mechanisms describing the formation of the secondary VOCs. Intriguingly, under light irradiation the formation of valeraldehyde was observed based on the photosensitized chemistry of acetophenone which is a constituent of the cleaning agent. Finally, we modeled the observed mixing ratios of three aldehydes, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 4-oxopentanal with respect to real-life indoor environment. The results suggest that secondary VOCs initiated by ozone chemistry can additionally impact the indoor air pollution.
