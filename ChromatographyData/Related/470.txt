Title: Comparison of aroma active compounds in cold- and hot-pressed walnut oil by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-olfactory-mass spectrometry and headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry

Abstract: Aroma composition of cold-pressed walnut oil (CWO) and hot-pressed walnut oil (HWO) was analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-olfactory-mass spectrometry (GC × GC-O-MS) and headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS). A total of 83 and 197 compounds were identified in the CWO and HWO, respectively; among these, 76 and 123 compounds were sniffed exclusively by GC × GC-O-MS, respectively. A total of 36 volatile compounds were detected by HS-GC-IMS, of which 10 in CWO and 32 in HWO. Based on of flavor dilution (FD) factors, odor-activity values (OAVs), and recombination and omission experiments, 1-octen-3-ol, cyclohexanol, and benzaldehyde were found to be the key aroma-active compounds in CWO, while 3-methylbutanal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, nonanal, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-pentanol, 1-octanol, and furfural were the key aroma-active compounds in HWO. Moreover, Maillard reaction and lipid oxidation were found to play an important role in flavor formation in HWO. This study provides a guide to improve the quality of walnut oil based on aroma characteristics.
