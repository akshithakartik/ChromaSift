Title: A review on ion transport pathways and coordination chemistry between ions and electrolytes in energy storage devices

Abstract: The design and construction of energy storage systems, such as batteries and supercapacitors, represent one of the most pioneering research domains in scientific landscape. Consequently, electrolytes assume a pivotal role as indispensable components, while a profound understanding of electrolyte chemistry and ion transfer pathways through electrolyte emerges as a potent tool for optimizing storage device design. This field of knowledge, known as coordination chemistry, elucidates the intricate interplay between ions, solvents, salts, and the electrolyte matrix, comprising polymer chains and ceramics, thereby providing invaluable insights into potential ion transport pathways. Thus, this discourse commences with an introduction and classification of electrolytes, followed by an in-depth exploration of ion transfer pathways in each case. Furthermore, the impact of the matrix, solvent, and salt on complex formation, ion coordination chemistry, and ionic conductivity is meticulously examined, thereby enhancing comprehension of these fundamental aspects.
