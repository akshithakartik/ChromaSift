Title: Scalability of Sartobind&lt;sup&gt;\xc2\xae&lt;/sup&gt; Rapid A Membrane for High Productivity Monoclonal Antibody Capture.

Abstract: Improved upstream titres in therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) production have shifted capacity constraints to the downstream process. The consideration of membrane-based chromatographic devices as a debottlenecking option is gaining increasing attention with the recent introduction of high-capacity bind and elute membranes. We have evaluated the performance and scalability of the Sartobind&lt;sup&gt;\xc2\xae&lt;/sup&gt; Rapid A affinity membrane (1 mL) for high-productivity mAb capture. For scalability assessment, a 75 mL prototype device was used to process 100 L of clarified cell culture harvest (CH) on a novel multi-use rapid cycling chromatography system (MU-RCC). MabSelect\xe2\x84\xa2 PrismA (4.7 mL) was used as a benchmark comparator for Protein A (ProtA) resin studies. Results show that in addition to a productivity gain of &gt;10\xc3\x97, process and product quality attributes were either improved or comparable to the benchmark. Concentrations of eluate pools were 7.5\xc3\x97 less than that of the benchmark, with the comparatively higher bulk volume likely to cause handling challenges at process scale. The MU-RCC system is capable of membrane operation at pilot scale with comparable product quality profile to the 1 mL device. The Sartobind&lt;sup&gt;\xc2\xae&lt;/sup&gt; Rapid A membrane is a scalable alternative to conventional ProtA resin chromatography for the isolation and purification of mAbs from harvested cell culture media.
