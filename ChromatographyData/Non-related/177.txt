Title: Diazo compounds: Recent applications in synthetic organic chemistry and beyond

Abstract: Diazo compounds, due to their diverse and rich chemical properties, have remained as one of the major domains in the organic chemistry research for long time. In the past two decades, the research activities related to diazo compounds have gained increased momentum. In addition to the synthetic organic chemistry, diazo compounds have also been explored in other fields such as polymer science and chemical biology. This Perspective will briefly highlight these achievements made in the past two decades.
