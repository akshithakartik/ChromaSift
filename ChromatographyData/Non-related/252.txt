Title: 2.01 Introduction: Bioinorganic chemistry and homogeneous biomimetic inorganic catalysis

Abstract: Arguably, the origins of Biological Inorganic Chemistry can be traced back to the mid 17th century when phosphorous could be isolated from the distillate of urine or to the mid 19th century with the discovery of hemoglobin. However, aggressive interest in the field began in the 1960s and has blossomed over the last 50years. As a field, its scientific range is enormous covering modern materials to molecular biology and so no single volume is capable of capturing the breadth nor the vitality of such an expansive area. Given that CIC published a volume on this topic in 2013, our job was to both update key developments in well-established areas and highlight interesting new fields of study in bioinorganic chemistry. In this volume, the most recent developments in this area have been covered in 25 excellent chapters.
