Title: Chapter 2 Analytical chemistry

Abstract: Analytical chemistry is a branch of chemistry that deals with determining the chemical components of substances in both qualitative and quantitative terms. In other words, analytical chemistry deals with the theory and practice of methods used to determine the composition of matter. It can be said that the history of analytical chemistry dates back to the first question of humans about the composition of an object. Analytical chemistry is widely used in different fields of science and has a vital role in the development of science. The ideas and techniques of analytical chemistry are used in all branches of chemistry. In addition, it plays a vital role in many research areas in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, geology, physics, engineering, medicine, and other sciences. The application of analytical chemistry in different fields of science enhances their development. Also, the application of different sciences allows for the advancement of interdisciplinary chemical analysis techniques. As a result, efficient analytical techniques could be developed. The interdisciplinary nature of chemical analysis makes it a vital tool in medical, industrial, government, and academic laboratories. In this chapter, the concept of chemical analysis and analytical chemistry will be explained briefly.
