Title: Purification of Recombinant Human Amphiphysin 1 and its N-BAR Domain.

Abstract: Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins are known as classical membrane curvature generators during endocytosis. Amphiphysin, a member of the N-BAR sub-family of proteins that contain a characteristic amphipathic sequence at the N-terminus of the BAR domain, is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Full-length amphiphysin contains a ~ 400 amino acid long disordered linker connecting the N-BAR domain and a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. We express and purify recombinant amphiphysin and its N-BAR domain along with an N-terminal glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag. The GST tag allows extraction of the protein of interest using affinity chromatography and is removed in the subsequent protease treatment and ion-exchange chromatography steps. In the case of the N-BAR domain, cleavage of the GST tag was found to cause precipitation. This issue can be minimized by adding glycerol to the protein purification buffers. In the final step, size exclusion chromatography removes any potential oligomeric species. This protocol has also been successfully used to purify other N-BAR proteins, such as endophilin, Bin1, and their corresponding BAR domains. Graphical overview.
