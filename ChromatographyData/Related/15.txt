Title: Two-dimensional chromatography for enantiomeric analysis of mitotane and its metabolite o,p′-DDA in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma indicates enantioselective metabolism

Abstract: Mitotane is a chiral drug used to treat adrenocortical carcinoma, being metabolized to the o,p’-dichlorodiphenyl acetic acid (o,p’-DDA), also a chiral compound. Despite of its therapeutic significance, the overall ratios and enantiomers have not been known. In this study, we analyzed the enantiomers of mitotane and o,p’-DDA in the plasma of patients by a newly developed chiral-phase method employed in two-dimensional chromatography. Important differences were observed in the ratio of (S)/(R)-mitotane, which varied substantially from 1:1.2 to 1:10 whereas the (S)/(R)-o,p’-DDA ratio was relatively conserved, at approximately 2:1. These findings provide evidence for the enantioselective metabolism and provide a method for further analyses of mitotane and metabolites, which can explain the variation in the therapeutic response.
