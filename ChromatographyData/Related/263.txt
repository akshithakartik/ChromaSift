Title: Development of a novel Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Tandem-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method to measure l-arginine metabolites in plasma

Abstract: Introduction
                  Arginine metabolism is involved in the regulation of several biological processes. Many liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry methods for the determination of arginine and its metabolites have been developed but they are time consuming and imply long pre-analytical procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop a rapid method for the simultaneous determination of arginine, citrulline, ornithine, symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginine and monomethylarginine in human plasma.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  The pre-analytical procedure consisted in a simple deproteinization. The chromatographic separation was performed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. Analytes detection was performed with a triple quadrupole equipped with electrospray ion source operating in positive ion mode. Mass spectrometry experiments were conducted in multiple reaction monitoring mode.
               
                  Results and conclusions
                  Recovery ranged from 92.2 to 108.0%. The within-run imprecision and between-run imprecision ranged from 1.5 to 6.8 % and 3.8 to 11.9%, respectively.
                  Carry over and matrix effect did not affect quantitative analysis. Extraction recovery was between 95 and 105 %. Stability after pre-analytical procedure was tested and all the metabolites were stable after 48 h at 4 °C.
                  In conclusion, our novel method allow a rapid and easy determination of arginine and its metabolites both for research and clinical routine use.
