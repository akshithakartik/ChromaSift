Title: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolite library for metabolomics: Evaluating column suitability using a scoring approach

Abstract: Untargeted metabolomic studies require an extensive set of analyte (metabolic) information to be obtained from each analyzed sample. Thus, highly selective, and efficient analytical methodologies together with reversed-phase (RP) or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) are usually applied in these approaches. Here, we present a performance comparison of five different chromatographic columns (C18, C8, RP Amide, zicHILIC, OH5 HILIC phases) to evaluate their sufficiency of analysis for a large analyte library, consisting of 817 authentic standards. By taking into account experimental chromatographic parameters (i.e. retention time, peak tailing and asymmetry, FWHM, signal-to-noise ratio and peak area and intensity), the proposed column scoring approach provides a simple criterion that may assist analysis in the select of a stationary phase for those metabolites of interest. RPLC methods offered better results regarding metabolic library coverage, while the zicHILIC stationary phase delivered a bigger number of properly eluted compounds. This study demonstrates the importance of choosing the most suitable configuration for the analysis of different metabolic classes.
