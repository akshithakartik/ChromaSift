Title: Enrichment and recovery of oligonucleotide impurities by N-Rich twin-column continuous chromatography

Abstract: N-Rich is a twin-column continuous chromatography technology well suited for small-scale isolation and the enrichment of product related impurities. For the first time, N-Rich was used for impurity isolation from a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) therapeutic synthetic oligonucleotide (ON), produced by solid-phase synthesis. By employing the N-Rich process, where the desired impurities are recycled and selectively enriched, and interfering substances are depleted, it was possible to obtain substantial amounts of high purity marginal impurities with a reproducible, automatized, and productive method. The productivity-purity tradeoff inherent to traditional impurity isolation methods, i.e., analytical chromatography, was effectively alleviated. Using N-Rich, satisfactory purity values and mass recoveries of several low-concentrated impurities could be obtained simultaneously.
                  A performance comparison demonstrated an up to 15-fold increase for purity values and up to 20-fold mass impurity isolation and concentration with the N-Rich technology in comparison to conventional isolation procedures, drastically reducing processing times, manual handling, and waste production.
