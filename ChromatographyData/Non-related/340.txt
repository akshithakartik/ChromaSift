Title: Characterisation of the surface chemistry of carbon materials by temperature-programmed desorption: An assessment

Abstract: The increasing role assumed by carbon materials in technological applications is intrinsically linked to a better understanding of carbon surface chemistry as a result of reliable methods of analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) techniques allow to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on individual functional groups on the carbon surface. In this context, TPD has established itself as an alternative technique to the Boehm titration methodology or XPS, being especially adequate for the characterisation of oxygen functional groups on carbon materials with extended porosity. This work reviews the fundamentals and methodology to perform a correct TPD-MS analysis and assessment (qualitatively and quantitatively) of the oxygenated functional groups. The applicability of the information obtained by TPD to correlate the properties of carbon materials with their performance in practical applications is also revised.
