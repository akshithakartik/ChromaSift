Title: Challenges and emerging trends in liquid chromatography-based analyses of mRNA pharmaceuticals

Abstract: Lipid encapsulated messenger RNA (LNP mRNA) has garnered a significant amount of interest from the pharmaceutical industry and general public alike. This attention has been catalyzed by the clinical success of LNP mRNA for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination as well as future promises that might be fulfilled by the biotechnology pipeline, such as the in vivo delivery of a CRISPR/Cas9 complex that can edit patient cells to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein. LNP mRNAs are comprised of various chemically diverse molecules brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex. This can make it challenging to achieve thorough analytical characterization. Nevertheless, liquid chromatography is becoming an increasingly relied upon technique for LNP mRNA analyses. Although there have been significant advances in all types of LNP mRNA analyses, this review focuses on recent developments and the possibilities of applying anion exchange (AEX) and ion pairing reversed phase (IP-RP) liquid chromatography for intact mRNAs as well as techniques for oligo mapping analysis, 5â€™ endcap testing and lipid compositional assays.
