Title: New developments in separation science will help to contribute to the democratisation of analytical chemistry

Abstract: New developments in separation science demonstrate that instrumentation has reduced significantly in size and complexity in recent years. Implementing various miniature sensors (like contactless conductivity or LED-based optical) as detectors and automatisation of their operation through microcontrollers, one can talk about a new type of analytical instrumentation: smart sensors. Such new instruments would become useful for citizen science due to lack of sophistication of their construction (do-it-yourself feature) and ease of operation. In this respect, two separation techniques are especially promising: sensor gas chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. As an added value, the miniature instruments meet most of the criteria of green analytical chemistry, thus helping to make our world more sustainable.
