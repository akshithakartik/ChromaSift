Title: Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopic profiling and cytotoxic activity of Riccia billardieri Mont. & nees (Bryophyta: Liverwort)

Abstract: Liverworts are a highly diverse group of bryophytes containing flavonoids and polyphenols. The significance of liverworts in therapeutic applications has recently been highlighted due to their antiviral and cytotoxic properties. This study has undertaken an effort to identify the phytochemical profiling (total phenolic and flavonoid content) of liverwort (Riccia billardieri) in Rajasthan. A wide range of botanical elements was predicted by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and the resultant profiles were analyzed for potential therapeutic properties against colorectal cancer.
