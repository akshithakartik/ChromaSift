Title: Comparative characterization and contribution of key aroma compounds in the typical base liquor of &lt;i&gt;Jiang&lt;/i&gt;-flavor &lt;i&gt;Baijiu&lt;/i&gt; from different distributions in the Chinese Chishui River basin.

Abstract: The characteristic of typical base liquor is crucial in controlling ultimate quality of &lt;i&gt;Jiang&lt;/i&gt;-flavor &lt;i&gt;Baijiu&lt;/i&gt;. This study investigates the flavor compounds of three typical base liquors (&lt;i&gt;Jiangxiang&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chuntian&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Jiaodixiang&lt;/i&gt;) by LLE/LLME/HS-SPME, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID), sensory analysis, and odor activity value (OAV). Of the 201 main volatile compounds identified, 37 significant compounds distinguished the three typical base liquors. Acid (441.72\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.17\xe2\x80\xafmg/L), alcohol (5388.88\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.55\xe2\x80\xafmg/L), and ester compounds (8181.64\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.15\xe2\x80\xafmg/L) were respectively marked in &lt;i&gt;Jiangxiang&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chuntian&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Jiaodixiang&lt;/i&gt; typical base liquors. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), correlation analysis, and aroma recombination showed that butyric acid (OAV: 102.23), butyl 2-methylbutyrate (OAV: 6045.59), and ethyl caproate (OAV: 418.37) were significantly correlated with sweet, fruity, pit mud, &lt;i&gt;jiang&lt;/i&gt;, and ethanol aromas. It identifies the primary constituents that affect flavor variations in the three typical base liquors and provides guidance for investigations on the flavor formation of &lt;i&gt;Jiang&lt;/i&gt;-flavor &lt;i&gt;Baijiu&lt;/i&gt;.
