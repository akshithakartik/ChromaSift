Title: Controlling monoclonal antibody aggregation during cell culture using medium additives facilitated by the monitoring of aggregation in cell culture matrix using size exclusion chromatography

Abstract: Controlling monoclonal antibody aggregation at the upstream stage itself can significantly reduce the burden on downstream processing and can improve the process yield. Hence, we have investigated the use of sugar osmolytes (glucose, mannose, sucrose and maltose) and formulation excipients (mannitol, polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80) as medium additives to reduce protein aggregation during cell culture. Aggregate content in cell culture samples was estimated using a high-resolution size-exclusion chromatography technique, which efficiently resolved the antibody monomer and aggregates in the cell culture matrix i.e., without purification. Glucose, mannose, maltose and the polysorbates effectively reduced the mean aggregate content over the course of the culture. Sugar-based additives exhibited a higher degree of variation during aggregate quantitation as compared to polysorbate additives, rendering the latter a preferred additive. Therefore, this study demonstrated the potential of sugar osmolytes and formulation excipients as media additives during cell culture to reduce aggregate formation, without negatively impacting cell growth and antibody production, facilitated by the monitoring of aggregate content in cell culture samples without purification.
