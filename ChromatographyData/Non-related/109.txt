Title: Exploring the connections between systems thinking and green chemistry in the context of chemistry education: A scoping review

Abstract: This study presents a systematic scoping review of the literature focusing on the connections between systems thinking and green chemistry in the context of green chemistry education. The review maps extant research and, through a process of thematic synthesis, it investigates the role of systems thinking in supporting green chemistry education. The methodological search resulted in the identification of a total of 44 studies (published between 2004 and 2020) which were subsequently analyzed to establish the characteristics of existing evidence and provide answers to the research questions of the study. Specific connections between green chemistry and systems thinking were identified, together with a set of learning objectives which may been used for promoting their integration. The existence of several educational contexts and topics that take advantage of the two interrelated perspectives shows the large potential of the research field which however is still in its infancy.
