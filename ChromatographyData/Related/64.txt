Title: Determination of tobacco-specific nitrosamines in tobacco and mainstream cigarette smoke using one-step clean-up coupled with liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry

Abstract: A method for determining tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) in tobacco and cigarette smoke using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was established. The established method amended the deficiencies that exist in current mainstream methods. In this method, TSNAs in tobacco and cigarette smoke were extracted by water. The aqueous extract was then extracted by dichloromethane, and the extract could be analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after a solvent replacement. This method was used to analyze flue-cured tobacco samples, and the response of the target compounds was about 10 times higher than that of the ammonium acetate extraction method. When analyzing cigarette smoke samples, the response strength and chromatographic peak purity of the target compounds were also significantly improved. The proposed method exhibited good linearities for both tobacco and cigarette smoke samples (r
                     2 > 0.99). The limits of detection (LODs) for tobacco and cigarette smoke samples were 0.2–1.0 ng/g and 0.1–0.3 ng/cigarette, respectively. Additionally, this method exhibited desirable accuracy and precision. The TSNAs recovery values from tobacco and cigarette smoke samples ranged from 95.7 % to 107.7 % with inter- and intra-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) of less than 7.4 %. This method is simple, effective, and has wide adaptability. It is a useful upgrade to the existing methods for analyzing TSNAs in tobacco and cigarette smoke.
