Title: Expression and Purification of scFv&lt;sub&gt;2H7&lt;/sub&gt;-P18F3, a Bi-Modular Fusion Protein (BMFP) Targeting Human CD20.

Abstract: P18F3-based bi-modular fusion proteins (BMFPs), designed to re-direct pre-existing anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) endogenous polyclonal antibodies towards defined target cells, demonstrated efficient biological activity in a mouse tumor model and could potentially represent a universal and versatile platform to develop novel therapeutics against a broad range of diseases. This protocol provides step-by-step instructions for expressing scFv&lt;sub&gt;2H7&lt;/sub&gt;-P18F3, a BMFP targeting human CD20, in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (SHuffle&lt;sup&gt;\xc2\xae&lt;/sup&gt;), and for purifying soluble proteins using a two-step process, namely immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by size exclusion chromatography. This protocol can also be used for expression and purification of other BMFPs with alternative binding specificities.
