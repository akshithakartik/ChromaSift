Title: Reinventing the wheel: A critical look at one-world and circular chemistries

Abstract: With the rise of environmental awareness among chemists, more and more programmatic frameworks try to guide chemists to conduct research in an ethical manner. While green chemistry remains the most popular and influential of these concepts, not all scholars choose to embrace it. One world chemistry and circular chemistry are examples of this new trend. They constitute an attempt to profoundly reshape the practice of chemistry along new lines to make the discipline more relevant to the changing social, environmental and economic reality. And yet, both concepts betray a lack of familiarity with the recent history of chemistry and of sustainability undermining their overall message. The article indicates that the history of chemistry can play a crucial role in enriching the conversation on the direction chemistry should take towards the socio-environmental transition.
