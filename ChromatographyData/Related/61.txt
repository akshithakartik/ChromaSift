Title: Separation and structural characterization of unknown impurity in vancomycin by two-dimensional preparative liquid chromatography, LC-MS and NMR

Abstract: Vancomycin is an effective antibiotic used for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. During the analysis of vancomycin, an unknown impurity at the level of 0.5% was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To characterize the structure of the impurity, a new two-dimensional preparative liquid chromatography (2D-Prep-LC) method was developed to separate the impurity from the vancomycin sample. After further analysis including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the structure of the unknown impurity was identified as a vancomycin analog in which the N-Methyl-leucine residue on the side chain is replaced by an N-methylmethionine residue. In this study, we established a reliable and efficient method for separating and identifying vancomycin impurities, which will provide a valuable contribution to the field of pharmaceutical analysis and quality control.
