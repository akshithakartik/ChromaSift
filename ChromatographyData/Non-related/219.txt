Title: Coordination chemistry for innovative carbon-related materials

Abstract: With the emergence of energy and environmental problems and the deepening of devices to solve these problems, the demand for carbon materials is increasing and higher performance is required. While a variety of scientific knowledge has been poured into the creation of innovative carbon materials, coordination chemistry also makes a significant contribution to the creation of innovative carbon materials, especially for metal-containing carbon materials. In this review, we summarize the new carbon and related materials opened up by complex chemistry. In the first chapter, the prospect of this review is mentioned as an introduction. There are various methods for synthesizing carbon materials mediated by complex chemistry, and these are listed in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, we summarize the various applications of coordination-chemistry-based carbon materials. In Chapter 4, we discuss the potential of conductive molecular frameworks as new materials that can replace or surpass carbon materials. Chapter 5 summarizes this review and presents the future challenges and prospects of coordination-chemistry-based carbon and related materials.
