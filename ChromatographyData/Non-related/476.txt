Title: Investigating the role of consumers, producers, and policymakers: A case of leather supply chain towards sustainable chemistry

Abstract: The sustainable chemistry (SCh) approaches are used to reduce the chemical hazards of chemical processes by acquiring resource efficiency along with social and economic benefits. The leather industry is considered as a chemical-intensive industry in the world. Therefore, it requires careful consideration of SCh approaches towards greening the leather processing. The SCh approaches may provide a significant role in making leather processing eco-friendly. In this regard, the consumers, producers, and policymakers contribute immensely to build the leather supply chain (LSC) more sustainable. Previous studies focused on the various sustainability issues but SCh-based approaches towards making eco-friendly and sustainable leather processing have received less attention. Hence, this study analysed the previous works to find the gaps that helped to propose the roles of consumers, producers, and policymakers in making sustainable leather processing. This review will accelerate policymakers, stakeholders, government, and private agencies to introduce the SCh-based approaches in the LSC.
