Title: Inquiry-based learning and students’ self-efficacy in Chemistry among secondary schools in Kenya

Abstract: Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) influences educational outcomes such as test scores, students’ attitudes, and self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is a significant predictor of the academic performance of students and therefore it is an important construct for measuring attainment of learning objectives. This paper discusses how inquiry-based learning in Chemistry practical lessons enhances students' self-efficacy in Chemistry. A total of 21 Chemistry teachers and 357 Form three Chemistry students were randomly selected from the 21 classrooms that these teachers taught. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods research design was employed. Data was gathered using an adapted teachers’ self-reported IBL instrument and a lesson observation schedule was used to rate the teachers’ IBL use in Chemistry practical lessons. Besides, a 26 item instrument was also adapted from existing literature to measure students’ self-efficacy in Chemistry. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to determine the suitability of measuring tools. Means and percentages were used to examine IBL use and students’ self-efficacy while Pearson Correlation coefficient and regression analysis were used to examine the influence of IBL on learners' self-efficacy. Results revealed that teachers used inquiry-based learning once a week (overall mean = 3.89). Also, students’ rating of their self-efficacy in Chemistry was high (Mean = 3.929). Finally, the results from correlation and regression analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between inquiry-based learning and students’ self-efficacy in Chemistry (r = 0.903, p < 0.05, R2 = 0.8155).
