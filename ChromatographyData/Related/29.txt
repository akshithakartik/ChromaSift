Title: Rapid purification of rabbit immunoglobulins using a single-step, negative-selection chromatography

Abstract: Custom polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits are routinely used in immunoblotting and other protein analysis techniques. Custom rabbit polyclonal antisera are generally purified using immunoaffinity or Protein A-affinity chromatography; however, these methods require harsh elution conditions that can compromise the antigen binding efficacy. We evaluated the utility of Melonâ„¢ Gel chromatography for purification of IgG from crude rabbit serum. We show that Melon Gel-purified rabbit IgGs are active and perform well in immunoblotting. In summary, the Melon Gel method is a rapid, one-step, negative-selection approach that can be employed in either preparative or small-scale format to purify IgG from crude rabbit serum without the need for denaturing eluent.
