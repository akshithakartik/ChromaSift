Title: Applications of vesicle-based artificial cells in analytical chemistry: A review

Abstract: Artificial cells have similar morphological characteristics as natural ones and can mimic many functions of the latter. Artificial cells constructed with liposomes and vesicles have good biocompatibility, a feature that is widely used in biomedicine. In addition, liposomes are good carriers of aqueous solutions, and biomolecules can be loaded onto cell membranes as recognition sites for other substances. This feature of liposomes has been extensively utilized in biosensor platforms. In this review, we explore the application of artificial cell in analytical chemistry. The fabrication methods of artificial cells and the main materials of artificial cell membranes are surveyed. The location of signals generated by artificial cells as analysis units, the types of analytes, and commonly used detection methods are of particular focus in this article. Finally, the review provides new perspectives and an outlook for the development of analytical chemistry applications based on artificial cells.
