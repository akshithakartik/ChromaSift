Title: The role of textural properties and surface chemistry of activated carbon support in catalytic deoxygenation of triglycerides into renewable diesel

Abstract: The textural properties and surface chemistry of activated carbon support are commonly known to have influence on the catalytic performance of catalysts. Many authors have assessed the effect of textural properties and surface chemistry of activated carbon support in the deoxygenation of triglycerides. This review focuses on reconciling literature on the role/relevance of textural properties and surface chemistry of activated carbon support in deoxygenation of triglycerides into diesel-like hydrocarbons. It is revealed that different activated carbon (AC) exhibit distinct effects on the catalytic behaviors of the supported catalyst. The degree of influence of both textural properties and surface chemistry of AC support varies with the nature of the supported catalyst.
