Title: Mechanistic study of ultrasound-assisted chromatography using plastic and stainless steel columns

Abstract: Based on the previous ultrasound-assisted chromatography (UAC) studies on plastic and stainless steel (SS) columns, this study explores the UAC mechanism by comparatively analyzing ultrasound effects on plastic and SS columns with C18 stationary phase when separating a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under various ultrasound intensities. The results showed a substantial difference in H values between the PEEK and SS columns under the influence of ultrasound agitation. Specifically, for the pyrene peak, as the ultrasonic intensity increased from 0% to 100% of 900 W, the H values of the SS column slightly rose from 8.82 μm to 9.86 μm. Conversely, the corresponding values for the PEEK column exhibited a significant 12-fold increase from 11.5 μm to 134 μm. The findings demonstrated poor penetration of ultrasound energy through the SS column, and the temperature rise of the medium induced by the ultrasound was the primary contributing factor to PAH separation. However, ultrasound easily penetrated through the plastic column, resulting in acoustic cavitation within the C18 polyether ether ketone (PEEK) column. Cavitation induced heat generation and contributed to a decrease in retention time and the magnitude of peak broadening or distortion, depending on the specific ultrasonic energy. Based on the estimated change in inlet temperature of the PEEK column due to an acoustic effect, the comparison with temperature effects under non-sonic conditions consistently demonstrated a stronger acoustic effect in reducing the retention time, by 2–9%, depending on specific peaks and pairs. We revisited the previously described separation mechanism of ultrasound-assisted ion chromatography and conjoined with our findings to infer and establish a thorough explanation for the previously unexplained separation mechanism of chiral separation and size exclusion chromatography by UAC using SS columns.
