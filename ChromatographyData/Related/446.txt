Title: Magnetic ionic liquid-based liquid-liquid microextraction followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry for simultaneous determination of neurotransmitters in human cerebrospinal fluid and plasma

Abstract: A green, efficient and easy sample pretreatment method of magnetic ionic liquid-based liquid-liquid microextraction (MIL-based LLME) combined with a sensitive, rapid and precise analytical method of ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ/MS2) was developed to simultaneously - determining of neurotransmitters (NTs) in biosamples. Two magnetic ionic liquids (MILs), [P6,6,6,14]3[GdCl6] and [P6,6,6,14]2[CoCl4] tested, and the latter was selected as the extraction solvent due to its advantages of visual recognition, paramagnetic behavior and higher extraction efficiency. Facile magnetic separation of MIL containing analytes from matrix was realized by applying external magnetic field without rather than centrifugation. Experimental parameters that would influence the extraction efficiency, including type and amount of MIL, extraction time, speed of the vortex process, salt concentration, and environmental pH, were optimized obtained. The proposed method was successfully applied to the simultaneous extraction and determination of 20 NTs in human cerebrospinal fluid and plasma samples. Excellent analytical performance indicates the broad potential of this method for clinical diagnosis and therapy of neurological diseases.
