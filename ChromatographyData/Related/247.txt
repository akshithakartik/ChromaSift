Title: Analysis of environmental pollutants using ion chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry: A review

Abstract: The rise of emerging pollutants in the current environment and requirements of trace analysis in complex substrates pose challenges to modern analytical techniques. Ion chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (IC-MS) is the preferred tool for analyzing emerging pollutants due to its excellent separation ability for polar and ionic compounds with small molecular weight and high detection sensitivity and selectivity. This paper reviews the progress of sample preparation and ion-exchange IC-MS methods in the analysis of several major categories of environmental polar and ionic pollutants including perchlorate, inorganic and organic phosphorus compounds, metalloids and heavy metals, polar pesticides, and disinfection by-products in past two decades. The comparison of various methods to reduce the influence of matrix effect and improve the accuracy and sensitivity of analysis are emphasized throughout the process from sample preparation to instrumental analysis. Furthermore, the human health risks of these pollutants in the environment with natural concentration levels in different environmental medias are also briefly discussed to raise public attention. Finally, the future challenges of IC-MS for analysis of environmental pollutants are briefly discussed.
