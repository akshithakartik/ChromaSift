Title: Passerini reaction: Synthesis and applications in polymer chemistry

Abstract: Passerini reaction is one of the most versatile reactions studied in organic chemistry and the products derived from the reaction have found their utilizing in various fields, such as natural product chemistry, heterocyclic chemistry, biomedical science, pharmaceutical industry, macrocyclic chemistry, polymer science and carbohydrate chemistry. Over the years, multicomponent reactions, especially Passerini reaction has become an important approach for the design and synthesis of macromolecules and polymeric materials. It allows for easy modification of the polymeric material, thus enabling the synthesis of multifunctional materials. Herein, we have discussed the synthesis and applications of Passerini reaction in polymer chemistry.
