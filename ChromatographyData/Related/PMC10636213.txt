Title: Comparison of the Fatty Acid Composition and Small Molecular Metabolites between Yanjin Blackbone Chicken and Piao Chicken Meat.

Abstract: The fatty acid composition and small molecular metabolites in breast and leg meat of Yanjin blackbone chickens (YBC) and Piao chickens (PC) were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-quadrupole static field orbital trap mass spectrometry. Thirty-two fatty acids were detected, and the total fatty acid content of PC was significantly higher than that of YBC (p&lt;0.05). Oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, and arachidonic acid were the main fatty acids in the two chicken varieties, and the composition of fatty acids in the two varieties were mainly unsaturated fatty acids, being more than 61.10% of the total fatty acids. Meanwhile, 12 and 16 compounds were screened out from chicken legs and chicken breasts of YBC and PC, respectively, which had important contributions to the differences between groups.
