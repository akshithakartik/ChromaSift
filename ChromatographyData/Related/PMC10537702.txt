Title: The Effect of Sample Pretreatment on the Anthocyanin Content in Czech Wild Elderberry (&lt;i&gt;Sambucus nigra&lt;/i&gt; L.).

Abstract: This work focusses on the analysis of anthocyanins present in wild Czech elderberries, using spectrophotometric methods and liquid chromatography. Spectrophotometric methods were used to determine antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content, and total anthocyanin content. Further, four major elderberry anthocyanins were determined using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with isocratic elution of 30% aqueous methanol with 5% of formic acid. All optimised methods were applied to the analysis of extracts prepared from frozen and dried elderberry fruit samples, and the results were evaluated using principal component analysis which clearly divided the samples into individual groups according to the sample pretreatment (frozen and dried samples). The frozen samples reached higher values of antioxidant capacity and total phenolic and anthocyanin contents compared to the dried samples, probably due to the degradation of anthocyanins during the drying process.
