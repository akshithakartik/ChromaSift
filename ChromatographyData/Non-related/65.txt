Title: Chapter 4 Application of green chemistry for environmental remediation

Abstract: The application of a set of concepts known as “green chemistry” minimizes the creation, design and design of dangerous compounds for consumers and workers. Environmental remediation is the process of removing toxins from the environment. The environmental and health systems are being disturbed by the increase in anthropogenic environmental pollution. Significant progress has been made in eradicating pollution issues and protecting the environment, public health and industrial ecology as a result of an emerging understanding of environmental protection, pollution prevention and safer industrial ecology. Designing chemical processes and products in a way that minimizes or completely avoids the usage and production of hazardous compounds is known as environmentally friendly chemistry. This chapter discusses green chemistry methods for soil, groundwater and environmental remediation, as well as air and water purification. With the idea of employing the principles as a structured design framework, future trends in green chemistry are examined.
