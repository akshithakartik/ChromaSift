Title: Biomedicine meets nanozyme catalytic chemistry

Abstract: Nanozymes, tiny-sized artificial enzymes, hold promise in mimicking the catalytic actions of natural enzymes. The intersection between nanozyme and biomedicine has sparked significant interest, leading to extensive research in this interdisciplinary arena. To better understand this field and facilitate its ongoing growth, a comprehensive exposition of nanozyme catalytic chemistry and its typical biological applications is significant and necessary. This review first elaborates on the fundamentals of nanozyme catalytic chemistry. Then, current strategies to enhance the catalytic activity and specificity of nanozymes are enumerated with a discussion on some representative examples. Especially, we highlight the relationship between nanozyme and biomedicine in terms of biosensing, cancer therapy, and antibiotic treatment. Finally, current challenges and future outlooks in this booming field are outlined.
