Title: Impact of kelp forest on seawater chemistry – A review

Abstract: Kelp forests, globally distributed in cool temperate and polar waters, are renowned for their pivotal role in supporting species diversity and fostering macroalgae productivity. These high-canopy algal ecosystems dynamically influence their surroundings, particularly by altering the physicochemical properties of seawater. This review article aims to underscore the significance of kelp forests in modifying water masses. By serving as effective carbon sinks through the absorption of bicarbonate (HCO3
