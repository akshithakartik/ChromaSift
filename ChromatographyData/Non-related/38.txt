Title: Base metal chemistry and catalysis

Abstract: This perspective provides an entry-level conversation concerning base metal catalysis as a green and sustainable solution in industrial and academic contexts. We establish a definition of “base metal,” challenging readers to consider the ethical implications of metal sourcing. We explore what it means to be “sustainable” and provide information on current efforts in synthetic chemistry. We provide examples of current catalytic trends and transformations in popular fields such as cross-coupling and small-molecule conversion, highlighting relevant base metal systems. Finally, we consider social context—for example, decisions related to catalyst development are often driven by factors including costliness, safety, social adoptability (whether society will accept its usage), and performance. How do we move base metal catalysis to the forefront? Is society concerned if materials are fabricated from cheaper and more abundant sources? How does the synthetic chemistry community guide this knowledge translation?
