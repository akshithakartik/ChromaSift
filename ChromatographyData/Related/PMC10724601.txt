Title: Purification and characterization of a novel immunoregulatory peptide from &lt;i&gt;Sipunculus nudus&lt;/i&gt; L. protein.

Abstract: This study aimed to purify and characterize immunoregulatory peptides from &lt;i&gt;Sipunculus nudus&lt;/i&gt; L. and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were used to purify the peptide following enzymatic hydrolysis. Rates of lymphocyte proliferation and phagocytosis as well as nitric oxide (NO) production levels were used as indicators of immunoregulatory activity to screen the fractions. The amino acid sequence of the peptide, designated as SNLP, was identified as Arg-Val-Lys-Gly-Lys-Ile-Leu-Ala-Lys-Arg-Leu-Asn (RVKGKILAKRLN) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Treatment with the synthetic SNLP increased the proliferation and phagocytosis of RAW 264.7 macrophages and promoted the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-\xc9\x91 (TNF-\xce\xb1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1\xce\xb2 (IL-1\xce\xb2), and NO levels. The mRNA levels of these cytokines and iNOS were also increased by SNLP. Our results provide preliminary evidence suggesting that SNLP acts as a dual immunomodulatory peptide with immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. In summary, SNLP derived from &lt;i&gt;Sipunculus nudus&lt;/i&gt; L. is a potent immunoregulatory peptide and represents a potential functional food or immunoregulatory drug.
