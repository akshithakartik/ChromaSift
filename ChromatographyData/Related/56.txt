Title: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in fat-soluble vitamin deficiency

Abstract: Fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D, E, and K, are essential for maintaining normal body function and metabolism. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency may lead to bone diseases, anemia, bleeding, xerophthalmia, etc. Early detection and timely interventions are significant for preventing vitamin deficiency-related diseases. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is developing into a potent instrument for the precise detection of fat-soluble vitamins due to its high sensitivity, high specificity, and high resolution.
