Title: Effect of time-invariant pressure gradients on peak formation and efficiency in ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography

Abstract: In chromatography, pressure can affect the retention factors of compounds significantly. In liquid chromatography, this effect is primarily related to the change in the molecular volume of solute during adsorption that is remarkably high for large biomolecules such as peptides and proteins. As a result, the migration velocities of chromatographic bands vary spatially through the column affecting the degree of band broadening. In this work, based on theoretical considerations, chromatographic efficiencies are studied under pressure-induced gradient conditions. The retention factor and migration velocity of different components are examined, and it is shown that components with the same retention time can have different migration patterns. The width of the initial band after injection is affected by the pressure gradient, providing significantly thinner initial bands for compounds with higher pressure sensitivity. In addition to classical band broadening phenomena, the influence of pressure gradients on band broadening is remarkable. The positive velocity gradient leads to extra band broadening. Our results clearly demonstrate that the zones are significantly wider at the end of the column if the change of molar volume of solute during adsorption is large. If the pressure drop is increasing, this effect becomes more significant. In the same time, the high release velocity of the bands somewhat counteracts the extra band broadening effect, however, it can not offset it perfectly. As a result, the separation efficiency of large biomolecules is decreased significantly due to the chromatographic pressure gradient. Under UHPLC conditions, the extent of apparent efficiency loss can reach up to 50% compared to the intrinsic efficiency of the column.
