Title: Chemistry solutions to facilitate nanopore detection and analysis

Abstract: Characteristic ionic current modulations will be produced in a single molecule manner during the communication of individual molecules with a nanopore. Hence, the information regarding the length, composition, and structure of a molecule can be extracted from deciphering the electrical message. However, until now, achieving a satisfactory resolution for observation and quantification of a target analyte in a complex system remains a nontrivial task. In this review, we summarize the progress and especially the recent advance in utilizing chemistry solutions to facilitate nanopore detection and analysis. The discussed chemistry solutions are classified into several major categories, including covalent/non-covalent chemistry, redox chemistry, displacement chemistry, back titration chemistry, chelation chemistry, hydrolysis-chemistry, and click chemistry. Considering the significant success of using chemical reaction-assisted nanopore sensing strategies to improve sensor sensitivity & selectivity and to study various topics, other non-chemistry based methodologies can undoubtedly be employed by nanopore sensors to explore new applications in the interdisciplinary area of chemistry, biology, materials, and nanotechnology.
