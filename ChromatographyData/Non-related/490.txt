Title: From physics to chemistry of fresh blended cements

Abstract: Tomorrow's mineral binders are called on to integrate a growing proportion of mineral powders other than Portland clinker. This impacts most properties of industrial interest including fresh state properties, the focus of this paper.
                  We discuss the physical, physico-chemical and chemical changes that such an evolution in mix design is expected to induce.

                           Volume-driven effects (physics) control solid fraction, packing properties and strongly relate to particle shape, particle polydispersity and early hydrates morphology.

                           Surface-driven effects (physical chemistry) drive interparticle forces and admixtures adsorption, profoundly impacting the rheology by modifying the degree of dispersion.

                           Early hydration kinetics (chemistry) leads to hydrate nucleation and growth, which impact the above by modifying the specific surface area, admixture consumption and cohesion forces.
                        
                     
                  
                  We discuss the above features, their independence and their interplay and extrapolate the critical research questions and needs associated to a full understanding of the fresh properties of blended cements.
