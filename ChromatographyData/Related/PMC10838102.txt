Title: Investigating Bioavailability of Curcumin and Piperine Combination in Comparison to Turmeric Rhizomes: An in vitro Study.

Abstract: &lt;h4&gt;Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;To assess the permeability of the test item (a combination of curcumin and piperine) and a reference item (dried and crushed turmeric rhizomes) using a combination of Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.&lt;h4&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;In the Caco-2 cell assay, a transport buffer was prepared, and stock solutions of test and reference items were made. Caco-2 cells were cultured on transwell plates. Permeability assays were conducted for 2 and 6 hours, followed by post-experiment testing for assessing the monolayer integrity. LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry) analysis was performed to calculate apparent permeability of each item.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The test item was undetectable at the end of 2 hours of permeability assay. Further, after 6 hours of permeability assay, the permeability of both test and reference item was found to be low.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The results showed that the curcumin and piperine combination had low permeability of curcumin in vitro as compared to the dried and crushed turmeric rhizomes. This could predict the low bioavailability of curcumin in vivo when co-administered with piperine.
