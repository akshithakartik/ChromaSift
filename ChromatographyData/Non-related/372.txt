Title: Biosafety chemistry and biosafety materials: A new perspective to solve biosafety problems

Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly swept around the globe since its emergence near 2020. However, people have failed to fully understand its origin or mutation. Defined as an international biosafety incident, COVID-19 has again encouraged worldwide attention to reconsider the importance of biosafety due to the adverse impact on personal well-being and social stability. Most countries have already taken measures to advocate progress in biosafety-relevant research, aiming to prevent and solve biosafety problems with more advanced techniques and products. Herein, we propose a new concept of biosafety chemistry and reiterate the notion of biosafety materials, which refer to the interdisciplinary integration of biosafety and chemistry or materials. We attempt to illustrate the exquisite association that chemistry and materials science possess with biosafety -science, and we hope to provide a pragmatic perspective on approaches to utilize the knowledge of these two subjects to handle specific biosafety issues, such as detection and disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms, personal protective equipment, vaccine adjuvants and specific drugs, etc.. In addition, we hope to promote multidisciplinary cooperation to strengthen biosafety research and facilitate the development of biosafety products to defend national security in the future.
