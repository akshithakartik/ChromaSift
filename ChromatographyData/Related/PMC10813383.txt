Title: Age-Related Changes in Serum &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Glycome in Men and Women-Clusters Associated with Comorbidity.

Abstract: (1) Aim: To describe, in a general adult population, the serum &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;glycome in relation to age in men and women, and investigate the association of &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;glycome patterns with age-related comorbidity; (2) Methods: The serum &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;glycome was studied by hydrophilic interaction chromatography with ultra-performance liquid chromatography in 1516 randomly selected adults (55.3% women; age range 18-91 years). Covariates included lifestyle factors, metabolic disorders, inflammatory markers, and an index of comorbidity. Principal component analysis was used to define clusters of individuals based on the 46 glycan peaks obtained in chromatograms; (3) Results: The serum &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;glycome changed with ageing, with significant differences between men and women, both in individual &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;glycan peaks and in groups defined by common features (branching, galactosylation, sialylation, fucosylation, and oligomannose). Through K-means clustering algorithm, the individuals were grouped into a cluster characterized by abundance of simpler &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycans and a cluster characterized by abundance of higher-order &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;glycans. The individuals of the first cluster were older, showed higher concentrations of glucose and glycation markers, higher levels of some inflammatory markers, lower glomerular filtration rate, and greater comorbidity index; (4) Conclusions: The serum &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;glycome changes with ageing with sex dimorphism. The &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;glycome could be, in line with the inflammaging hypothesis, a marker of unhealthy aging.
