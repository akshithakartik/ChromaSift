Title: Bioprospection of the Antarctic Diatoms &lt;i&gt;Craspedostauros ineffabilis&lt;/i&gt; IMA082A and &lt;i&gt;Craspedostauros zucchelli&lt;/i&gt; IMA088A.

Abstract: In extreme environments such as Antarctica, a diverse range of organisms, including diatoms, serve as essential reservoirs of distinctive bioactive compounds with significant implications in pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, nutraceutical, and biotechnological fields. This is the case of the new species &lt;i&gt;Craspedostauros ineffabilis&lt;/i&gt; IMA082A and &lt;i&gt;Craspedostauros zucchellii&lt;/i&gt; IMA088A Trentin, Moschin, Lopes, Cust\xc3\xb3dio and Moro (Bacillariophyta) that are here explored for the first time for possible biotechnological applications. For this purpose, a bioprospection approach was applied by preparing organic extracts (acetone and methanol) from freeze-dried biomass followed by the evaluation of their in vitro antioxidant properties and inhibitory activities on enzymes related with Alzheimer\'s disease (acetylcholinesterase: AChE, butyrylcholinesterase: BChE), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, \xce\xb1-glucosidase, \xce\xb1-amylase), obesity (lipase) and hyperpigmentation (tyrosinase). Extracts were then profiled by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-HR-MS/MS), while the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles were established by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results highlighted strong copper chelating activity of the acetone extract from &lt;i&gt;C. ineffabilis&lt;/i&gt; and moderate to high inhibitory activities on AChE, BChE, \xce\xb1-amylase and lipase for extracts from both species. The results of the chemical analysis indicated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and their derivatives as the possible compounds responsible for the observed activities. The FAME profile showed saturated fatty acids (SFA) as the main group and methyl palmitoleate (C16:1) as the predominant FAME in both species. Overall, our results suggest both Antarctic strains as potential sources of interesting molecules with industrial applications. Further studies aiming to investigate unidentified metabolites and to maximize growth yield and natural compound production are required.
