Title: Chromatography-free purification of (+)-dihydromyricetin through three-step tandem cavitation fractional precipitation

Abstract: In this study, a chromatography-free purification process through a three-step tandem cavitation fractional precipitation (CFP) was developed to obtain high-purity (+)-dihydromyricetin. Ultrasound and negative pressure were introduced simultaneously into three types of precipitation solutions (acetone-water, methanol-water, and ethanol-water) and precipitation was performed for 30Â min. The purity of (+)-dihydromyricetin after the three-step tandem CFP was >98 % and the overall yield was >90 %. In addition, the impurity removal patterns at each precipitation step were observed through reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography analysis, and the chemical structure of (+)-dihydromyricetin finally purified through the three-step tandem CFP was confirmed through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis.
