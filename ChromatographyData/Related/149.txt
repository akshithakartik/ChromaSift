Title: A rapid and sensitive method for determination of methylene-diphosphonate in rat bone using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry

Abstract: A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) in rat bone. This method employed derivatization of MDP and allowed rapid and sensitive quantification of MDP in rat shin bone. The analyte was extracted from the bone tissues with phosphoric acid and derivatized to MDP tetramethyl phosphonate using trimethylsilyl diazomethane (TMS-DAM). MDP tetramethyl phosphonate was then quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with high selectivity, accuracy, and precision. The total run time was 6.5 min. The lower limit of quantification was 2.00 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-assay precision (in RSD) calculated from quality control samples was less than 15%, and the accuracy was between 98.1% and 100.2%. The analytical process for the determination of MDP in rat bone is fully described, which is a pivotal step for further biomedical research on MDP.
