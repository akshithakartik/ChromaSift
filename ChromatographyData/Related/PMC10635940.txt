Title: Chromatographic purification of small extracellular vesicles using an affinity column for phospholipid membranes.

Abstract: &lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;This study aimed to investigate whether chromatography using an ExoPUA column, an affinity column for phospholipid membranes, could potentially serve as an efficient, rapid, scalable, and reproducible method for purifying small extracellular vesicles (sEVs).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We used the ExoPUA column connected to a fast-performance liquid chromatography system. One-step chromatographic purification of sEVs from culture supernatant using the ExoPUA protocol resulted in an 82\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8916-fold increase in purity with a yield of 38\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x895% of sEVs. The purified sEVs contained CD9, CD63, TSG101, and miRNA (miR-21), but not the endoplasmic reticulum protein Calnexin. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the purified sEVs were intact. The purification performance of the ExoPUA protocol showed superior results in terms of yield compared to that of the differential ultracentrifugation method, the most commonly used method for purifying sEVs in laboratories, and purity compared to that of the DEAE chromatography protocol.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The sEVs were effectively purified in the bind-elute mode and the ExoPUA column can be refreshed and sterilized with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), having high potential for multiple sEV purification in a scalable and industrial manner.
