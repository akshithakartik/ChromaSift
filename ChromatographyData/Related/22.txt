Title: Model-assisted process development, characterization and design of continuous chromatography for antibody separation

Abstract: Continuous manufacturing in monoclonal antibody production has generated increased interest due to its consistent quality, high productivity, high equipment utilization, and low cost. One of the major challenges in realizing continuous biological manufacturing lies in implementing continuous chromatography. Given the complex operation mode and various operation parameters, it is challenging to develop a continuous process. Due to the process parameters being mainly determined by the breakthrough curves and elution behaviors, chromatographic modeling has gradually been used to assist in process development and characterization. Model-assisted approaches could realize multi-parameter interaction investigation and multi-objective optimization by integrating continuous process models. These approaches could reduce time and resource consumption while achieving a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the process. This paper reviews the application of modeling tools in continuous chromatography process development, characterization and design. Model-assisted process development approaches for continuous capture and polishing steps are introduced and summarized. The challenges and potential of model-assisted process characterization are discussed, emphasizing the need for further research on the design space determination strategy and parameter robustness analysis method. Additionally, some model applications for process design were highlighted to promote the establishment of the process optimization and process simulation platform.
