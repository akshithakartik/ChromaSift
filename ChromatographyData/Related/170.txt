Title: Determination of multi-mycotoxins in vegetable oil via liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry assisted by a complementary liquid–liquid extraction

Abstract: The simultaneous determination of multi-mycotoxins in food commodities are highly desirable due to their potential toxic effects and mass consumption of foods. Herein, liquid chromatography-quadrupole exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry was proposed to analyze multi-mycotoxins in commercial vegetable oils. Specifically, the method featured a successive liquid–liquid extraction process, in which the complementary solvents consisted of acetonitrile and water were optimized. Resultantly, matrix effects were reduced greatly. External calibration approach revealed good quantification property for each analyte. Under optimal conditions, the recovery ranging from 80.8% to 109.7%, relative standard deviation less than 11.7%, and good limit of quantification (0.35 to 45.4 ng/g) were achieved. The high accuracy of proposed method was also validated. The detection of 20 commercial vegetable oils revealed that aflatoxins B1 and B2, zearalenone were observed in 10 real samples. The as-developed method is simple and low-cost, which merits the wide applications for scanning mycotoxins in oil matrices.
