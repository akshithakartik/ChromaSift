Title: Chapter 5 Approaches and challenges with respect to green chemistry in industries

Abstract: Green chemistry presents a plethora of issues for industrial chemists, coupled with a simultaneous impact of chances to increase and apply fresh strategies to enhance chemical production. Long-term growth in the economy entails the use of safe, sustainable resources in a sustainable manner and industrial output. Chemical sciences have a notion known as “green chemistry”, with production in either a socially and environmentally responsible manner, efficient, nonpolluting, utilizing the least amount of resources and energy even though generating no or very little trash. Chemical and related sectors may provide a diverse variety of critical items, ranging from plastics to medications. These industries, on the other hand, have the potential to cause significant environmental damage. As a result, green chemistry promotes the creation of ecologically safe materials as well as chemical practices. Green chemistry may become safer, more ecologically friendly and more sustainable by employing nontoxic chemicals and processes that do not put the ecosystem under threat. In this review, we look at some of the challenges and approaches that have been improved by employing to increase the resilience of industrial operations in green chemistry, and it suggests that successful “greener” chemistry in practice can lead to great possibilities for cutting-edge chemical studies and implementation in the industry.
