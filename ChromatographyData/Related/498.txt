Title: Immunoglobulin-binding protein-based affinity chromatography in bispecific antibody purification: Functions beyond product capture

Abstract: In general, purification of bispecific antibody (bsAb) is more challenging than that of monospecific antibody due to the increased complexity in byproduct profile. Like in the case of monospecific antibody purification, immunoglobulin-binding protein-based affinity chromatography is an indispensable tool for bsAb purification. For example, Protein A affinity chromatography has been widely used to capture Fc-containing bsAbs whereas other affinity media such as Protein L and KappaSelect, which bind kappa light chain, are used to capture bsAbs that do not contain a Protein A-binding site. In fact, affinity chromatography also possesses the capability of removing certain product-related impurities in bsAb purification when it is conducted with suitable medium and under appropriate conditions. Fully exploring the potential of affinity chromatography in bsAb purification to achieve both product capture and byproduct removal is highly desirable, as this can greatly alleviate the purification burden on subsequent polishing steps and hence improves the overall robustness of the downstream process. This article briefly reviews the byproduct clearance potential of several commonly used affinity media under relevant bsAb purification scenarios.
