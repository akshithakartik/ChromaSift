Title: Purification of Natural Pigments Violacein and Deoxyviolacein Produced by Fermentation Using &lt;i&gt;Yarrowia lipolytica&lt;/i&gt;.

Abstract: Violacein and deoxyviolacein are bis-indole pigments synthesized by a number of microorganisms. The present study describes the biosynthesis of a mixture of violacein and deoxyviolacein using a genetically modified &lt;i&gt;Y. lipolytica&lt;/i&gt; strain as a production chassis, the subsequent extraction of the intracellular pigments, and ultimately their purification using column chromatography. The results show that the optimal separation between the pigments occurs using an ethyl acetate/cyclohexane mixture with different ratios, first 65:35 until both pigments were clearly visible and distinguishable, then 40:60 to create a noticeable separation between them and recover the deoxyviolacein, and finally 80:20, which allows the recovery of the violacein. The purified pigments were then analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance.
