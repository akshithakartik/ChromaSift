Title: Beta-Blocker Separation on Phosphodiester Stationary Phases-The Application of Intelligent Peak Deconvolution Analysis.

Abstract: Beta-blockers are a class of medications predominantly used to manage abnormal heart rhythms. They are also widely used to treat high blood pressure. From the liquid chromatography separation point of view, beta-blockers are interesting molecules due to their hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties. Thus, the study aimed to investigate the beta-blocker separation selectivity on four phosphodiester stationary phases in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP LC) and hydrophilic interactions liquid chromatography (HILIC). On tested stationary phases, beta-blockers provide retention in both chromatographic systems, RP LC and HILIC. Additionally, it was found that cation-exchange mechanisms have a significant contribution to retention. Separations were enhanced by applying ChromSword software for gradient optimization and Intelligent Peak Deconvolution Analysis to separate unseparated peaks digitally.
