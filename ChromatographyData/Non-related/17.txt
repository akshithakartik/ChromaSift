Title: Micro/nano flow chemistry by Beyond Limits Manufacturing

Abstract: In September 2018, we proposed the cutting-edge concept of "Beyond Limits Manufacturing" (BLM). BLM technology is based on the three-dimensional inner engraving or precise outer engraving of ultra-fast laser, to invent micro/nano scale flow chips or devices, which makes it possible for the microform, integration, economy, safety, high efficiency, green and intelligence of research, development and manufacturing process, so as to realize transformational manufacturing in the era of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we reviewed the representative results we made in the field of micro/nano flow chemistry during the implementation of the BLM major project (December 2019 to August 2023), and discussed its application prospects in micro/nano flow chemistry.
