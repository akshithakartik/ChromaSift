Title: Electrochemical sensor for single-cell determination of bacteria based on target-triggered click chemistry and fast scan voltammetry

Abstract: Herein, an electrochemical sensor for single-cell determination of bacteria was developed based on target-triggered click chemistry and fast scan voltammetry (FSV). In it, bacteria not only are the detection target, but also can use their own metabolism to achieve first-level signal amplification. More electrochemical labels were immobilized on functionalized 2D nanomaterials to achieve second-level signal amplification. At 400 V/s, FSV can achieve third-level signal amplification. The linear range and limit of quantification (LOQ) are 1 ∼ 108 CFU/mL and 1 CFU/mL, respectively. When the reaction time of E. coli-instructed Cu2+ reduction is extended to 120 min, PCR-free single-cell determination of E. coli was achieved by electrochemical method first time. The feasibility of the sensor was verified by analysis of E. coli in seawater and milk samples with recoveries ranging from 94% to 110%. This detection principle is widely applicable, providing a new path for the establishment of single-cell detection strategy for bacteria.
