Title: Antifouling polyamide-amine/PVDF gel membrane via click chemistry method for high-efficiency oil/water emulsion separation

Abstract: Membrane fouling is an inevitable problem during the process of oil/water separation by membrane separation technology. In this work, we fabricated a polyamide-amine/PVDF gel membrane with hydrophilic surfaces via a thiol-alkene click chemical method. The polyamide-amine (PAMAM) dendrimer gel was grafted on the surface of PVDF membranes to improve hydrophilicity of membranes. The results showed that the obtained membrane possesses superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity repellent properties, along with excellent oil adhesion resistance. The water permeance can reach 12,300 L∙m‐2∙h‐1∙bar‐1 with a high recovery rate of 98%, with a prominent separation efficiency surpassing 98.5%. Furthermore, the gel membrane also displays remarkable environmental durability and recyclability, ensuring durable and effective separation of oily wastewater even in harsh chemical environments.
