Title: Chapter 1 Green Analytical Chemistry concepts, evolution, and recent developments

Abstract: This chapter deals with the growth of literature concerning Green Analytical Chemistry and the advancement of basic ideas about the development of green methodologies to solve as many as possible practical problems. Green Analytical Chemistry has grown due to the increasing social conscience about the environmental problems and the need to protect the world heritage for the future generations. Five basic aspects of Green Analytical Chemistry have been covered in detail: (1) The origin and evolution of Green Analytical Chemistry, (2) 12 Principles of Green Analytical Chemistry, (3) Green metrics tools, (4) Greening sample treatment and instrumental analysis, and (5) Chemometrics as an alternative tool for greening analytical practices. All these aspects together with additional efforts in teaching and diffusion activities will increase the impact of Green Analytical Chemistry in the future research, as well as a more friendly view of Analytical Chemistry by society.
