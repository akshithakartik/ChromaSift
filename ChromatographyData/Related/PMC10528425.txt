Title: Determination of Oxygen Heterocyclic Compounds in Foods Using Supercritical Fluid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.

Abstract: The aim of this research was to determine oxygen heterocyclic compounds in twenty-six &lt;i&gt;Citrus&lt;/i&gt;- and cinnamon-flavoured foods using supercritical fluid chromatography in combination with triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (SFC-QqQ-MS). According to the authors\' knowledge, this is the first report on the determination of these molecules in foods by means of the SFC-QqQ-MS technique. The analytical technique normally used for their determination in foods is liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode array detector. However, supercritical fluid chromatography is proving to be a valid alternative approach to investigating coumarins, furocoumarins and polymethoxyflavones. According to the results presented herein, each sample analysed showed the presence of molecules of interest. Coumarin was found in all the cinnamon-flavoured samples analysed in a low concentration. The presence of oxygen heterocyclic compounds in all the &lt;i&gt;Citrus&lt;/i&gt;-flavoured samples, according to the label, comfirmed that the foods selected for this research article were prepared with &lt;i&gt;Citrus&lt;/i&gt; fruits. Among the samples analysed, mandarin juice was the richest in bioactive compounds, representing a good source of polymethoxyflavones in a diet.
