Title: Green chemistry approach towards Piperazine: anticancer agents

Abstract: Through the exploitation of several conventional strategies in subdisciplines of chemistry and the molecular sciences became challenging due to toxic chemicals in last few years. As a result, there is a growing appreciation towards the newly emerging field of green chemistry which is required as an avenue for sustainable development of heterocyclic derivatives over conventional techniques with improved therapeutic efficacy. Hence, researchers endeavored to adopt environmentally benign green methods for synthesis of piperazine as nitrogen containing heterocyclic derivatives against cancer. With considerable efforts towards green chemistry, this review provides recent insights on several sustainable chemistry dependent synthetic strategies for piperazine analogues with significant inhibition of cancer cells such as, microwave assisted techniques, photoredox catalysis, green solvent, multicomponent single pot reaction and catalyst free synthesis. Accordingly, efforts are continually made by researchers to include these techniques for safe & effective synthetic reactions with the involvement of green solvents and catalysts in order to get product in maximum yield with lesser time consumption. It comprises a 15-year synthetic literature search. The significance of this work lies in its thorough literature review on piperazine containing heterocyclic compounds, and researchers working on the synthesis of piperazines can find a lot of helpful information on environmentally benign synthetic strategies for their development. Additionally, some in-silico based literature has also been cited to inquire the stable interaction between the piperazine structure and several targeted proteins in order to offer insightful information for future anticancer drug development.
