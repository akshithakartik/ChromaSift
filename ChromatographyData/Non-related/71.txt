Title: The chemistry of hydropersulfides (RSSH) as related to possible physiological functions

Abstract: Hydropersulfides (RSSH) are oxidized thiol (RSH) derivatives that have been shown to be biologically prevalent with likely important functions (along with other polysulfur compounds). The functional utility of RSSH can be gleaned from their unique chemical properties. That is, RSSH possess chemical reactivity not present in other biologically relevant sulfur species that should allow them to be used in specific ways in biology as effector/signaling molecules. For example, compared to RSH, RSSH are considered to be superior nucleophiles, reductants and metal ligands. Moreover, unlike RSH, RSSH can be either reductants/nucleophiles or oxidants/electrophiles depending on the protonated state. It has also become clear that studies related to the chemical biology and physiology of hydrogen suflide (H2S) must also consider the effects of RSSH (and related polysulfur species) as they are biochemically linked. Herein is a discussion of the relevant chemistry of RSSH that can serve as a basis for understanding how RSSH can be used by cells to, for example, combat stresses and used in signaling. Also, discussed are some current experimental studies regarding the biological activity of RSSH that can be explained by their chemical properties.
