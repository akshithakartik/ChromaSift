Title: Liquid and Thin-Layer Chromatography

Abstract: Liquid chromatography is a broad classification used to describe a variety of different chromatographic configurations that rely on the use of a liquid mobile phase. Paper, thin-layer, and classical column chromatography techniques, as well as high-performance liquid chromatography and ion chromatography, all belong to the class of liquid chromatography. A variety of separation mechanisms can be used within liquid chromatography; these include adsorption, ion-exchange, size-exclusion, affinity, and ion-pair formation. A discussion of these separation mechanisms can be found elsewhere in this encylopedia (see Chromatography: Basic Principles). This article gives an overview of classical, high-performance, and thin-layer chromatographic techniques including experimental configurations and forensic applications.
