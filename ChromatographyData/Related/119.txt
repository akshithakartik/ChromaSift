Title: Advanced error modeling and Bayesian uncertainty quantification in mechanistic liquid chromatography modeling

Abstract: Current mechanistic chromatography process modeling methods lack the ability to account for the impact of experimental errors beyond detector noise (e.g. pump delays and variable feed composition) on the uncertainty in calibrated model parameters and the resulting model-predicted chromatograms. This paper presents an uncertainty quantification method that addresses this limitation by determining the probability distribution of parameters in calibrated models, taking into consideration multiple realistic sources of experimental error. The method, which is based on Bayesâ€™ theorem and utilizes Markov chain Monte Carlo with an ensemble sampler, is demonstrated to be robust and extensible using synthetic and industrial data.
