Abstract: Transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) nanosheets are attractive two-dimensional (2D) materials, but they suffer from oxidation/degradation issues during storage and/or applications due to their sensitivity to water and oxygen. Despite the great research progress, the exact oxidation kinetics of Ti3C2T

                      nanosheets in an aqueous solution at room temperature over several weeks. We also studied the oxidation effects on the electrocatalytic properties of Ti3C2T

                      for hydrogen evolution reaction and found that the overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cmâˆ’1 increases from 0.435 to 0.877 V after three weeks of degradation, followed by being improved to stabilized values of around 0.40 V after eight weeks. These results suggest that severely oxidized MXene could be a promising candidate for designing efficient catalysts. According to our detailed experimental characterization and theoretical calculations, unlike previous studies, black titanium oxide is formed as the final product in addition to white Ti (IV) oxide and disordered carbons after the complete oxidation of Ti3C2T
