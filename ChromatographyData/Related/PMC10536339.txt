Title: Study of the Chemical Composition of &lt;i&gt;Rosa beggeriana&lt;/i&gt; Schrenk\'s Fruits and Leaves.

Abstract: &lt;i&gt;Rosa&lt;/i&gt; species are widely used in folk medicine in different countries of Asia and Europe, but not all species are studied in-depth. For instance, &lt;i&gt;Rosa beggeriana&lt;/i&gt; Schrenk, a plant which grows in Central Asia, Iran, and some parts of China, is little described in articles. Column and thin-layer chromatography methods were used to isolate biologically active substances. From a study of fruits and leaves of &lt;i&gt;Rosa beggeriana&lt;/i&gt; Schrenk, a large number of compounds were identified, seven of which were isolated: 3\xce\xb2,23-dihydroxyurs-12-ene (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), \xce\xb2-sitosterol (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), betulin (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), (+)-catechin (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), lupeol (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), ethyl linoleate (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), and ethyl linolenoate (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;). Their structures were elucidated by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, DEPT and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). The study also identified the structures of organic compounds, including volatile esters and acids. Consequently, comprehensive data were acquired concerning the chemical constitution of said botanical specimen.
