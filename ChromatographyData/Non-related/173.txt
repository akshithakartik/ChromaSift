Title: Roles and gains of coordination chemistry in nanofiltration membrane: A review

Abstract: The nanofiltration (NF) membranes with the specific separation accuracy for molecules with the size of 0.5–2 nm have been applied in various industries. However, the traditional polymeric NF membranes still face problems like the trade-off effect, organic solvent consumption, and weak durability in harsh conditions. The participation of coordination action or metal-organic coordination compounds (MOCs) brings the membrane with uniform pores, better antifouling properties, and high hydrophilicity. Some of the aqueous-phase reactions also help to introduce a green fabrication process to NF membranes. This review critically summarizes the recent research progress in coordination chemistry relevant NF membranes. The participation of coordination chemistry was classified by the various functions in NF membranes like additives, interlayers, selective layers, coating layers, and cross-linkers. Then, the effect and mechanism of the coordination chemistry on the performance of NF membranes are discussed in depth. Perspectives are given for the further promotion that coordination chemistry can make in NF processes. This review also provides comprehensive insight and constructive guidance on high-performance NF membranes with coordination chemistry.
