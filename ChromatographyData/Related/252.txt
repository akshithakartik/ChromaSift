Title: A review of fraction collection technology for supercritical fluid chromatography

Abstract: Separation and purification of complex mixtures are a necessity and a challenge in many industrial fields. Preparative chromatography is a technique used to separate, purify, and isolate the different components found in these complex mixtures. Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is an attractive technique in the industry due to its analysis speed, low analysis cost, green nature, and application space. As such, SFC has been appropriately scaled to match the industry's needs. An examination of preparative SFC is discussed, with this review focusing on the development and application of fraction collection. The various devices used to assist in the separation of the carbon dioxide mobile phase from the analyte and the modifier are described, as well as the techniques to control the fractionation. Applications of fraction collection are also discussed, with two-dimensional chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction coupled with SFC highlighted.
