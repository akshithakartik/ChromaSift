Title: Dilute-and-shoot coupled to mixed mode liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of persistent and mobile organic compounds in human urine

Abstract: In this work, a comprehensive method for the simultaneous determination of 33 diverse persistent and mobile organic compounds (PMOCs) in human urine was developed by dilute-and-shoot (DS) followed by mixed-mode liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MMLC-MS/MS). In the sample preparation step, DS was chosen since it allowed the quantification of all targets in comparison to lyophilization. For the chromatographic separation, Acclaim Trinity P1 and P2 trimodal columns provided greater capacity for retaining PMOCs than reverse phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. Therefore, DS was validated at 5 and 50 ng/mL in urine with both mixed mode columns at pH = 3 and 7. Regarding figures of merit, linear calibration curves (r2 > 0.999) built between instrumental quantification limits (mostly below 5 ng/mL) and 500 ng/mL were achieved. Despite only 60% of the targets were recovered at 5 ng/mL because of the dilution, all PMOCs were quantified at 50 ng/mL. Using surrogate correction, apparent recoveries in the 70–130% range were obtained for 91% of the targets. To analyse human urine samples, the Acclaim Trinity P1 column at pH = 3 and 7 was selected as a consensus between analytical coverage (i.e. 94% of the targets) and chromatographic runs. In a pooled urine sample, industrial chemicals (acrylamide and bisphenol S), biocides and their metabolites (2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, dimethyl phosphate, 6-chloropyridine-3-carboxylic acid, and ammonium glufosinate) and an artificial sweetener (aspartame) were determined at ng/mL levels. The outcomes of this work showed that humans are also exposed to PMOCs due to their persistence and mobility, and therefore, further human risk assessment is needed.
