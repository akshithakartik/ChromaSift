Title: Estimation of alginate purity and M/G ratio by methanolysis coupled with anion exchange chromatography

Abstract: Alginates are industrially relevant polysaccharides widely used in the food and biomedical industries for their excellent gelling properties. The growing emphasis on the valorization of marine resources has evidenced the need for alternative methods for the determination of both alginate content and the M/G ratio. This study describes the application of acid methanolysis and separation by anion exchange chromatography. Five samples, including alginates extracted from Saccharina latissima, Ascophyllum nodosum, a certified standard, and two poly-uronates (Poly-M and Poly-G), were analysed for their M/G ratio and alginate content at different treatment conditions, and compared with other conventionally used or reference methods (NMR, FTIR, and colorimetric methods). Quantitative estimation of alginate was relatively accurate at optimum conditions (4 h at 100 °C), as compared with the certified standard or with other colorimetric methods. M/G ratios were not significantly different from those determined after the reference method (1H NMR) or compared to FTIR protocols. The results evidence that methanolysis may be applied to simultaneously estimate the purity and M/G ratio of alginate-rich samples in a single analysis.
