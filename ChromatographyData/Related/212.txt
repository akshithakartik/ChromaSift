Title: Effect of salt modulators on the elution behavior of insulin and the separation of product-related impurities in reversed-phase chromatography

Abstract: In this work, the effect of the salt modulators potassium chloride, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, and potassium sulfate on the elution behavior of insulin in reversed-phase chromatography with ethanol as the organic modifier was investigated. Without the addition of salt modulators, insulin shows the formation of multiple peaks under non-linear loading conditions, presumably due to an aggregate formation equilibrium. Flow rate and temperature did not influence the appearance of multiple peaks. The addition of chloride and sulfate salt modulators changed the monomer-multimer equilibrium, and multi-peak formation no longer occurred. Chloride salts induce a Langmuirian elution behavior, whereas sulfate salts induce additional insulin-insulin interactions resulting in an anti-Langmuirian elution behavior. The elution behavior can be influenced by the combination of both chloride and sulfate salts and by varying the concentration ratio. The separation with respect to two product-related impurities also showed significant differences under Langmuirian and anti-Langmuirian elution conditions and the purification of insulin could be optimized. Induced anti-Langmuirian elution by lowering the chloride/sulfate ratio suppresses an observed tag-along effect of one variant resulting in a slightly smaller pool volume with increased insulin concentration and a significantly increased insulin recovery.
