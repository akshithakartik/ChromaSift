Title: Cation exchange chromatography removes FXIa from a 10% intravenous immunoglobulin preparation.

Abstract: The presence of residual activated coagulation factor XI (FXIa) in some commercial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products has been identified as the root cause of a small number of thromboembolic events in patients who had received such therapy. Our objectives here were to design and evaluate the manufacturing process of GC5107, a 10% glycine-stabilized IVIG product, for its capacity to remove FXIa. The manufacturing process included a cation exchange chromatography (CEX) step, which employs a resin that binds immunoglobulin G (IgG) with high capacity. Procoagulant activity was assessed using Western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, thrombin generation assay, chromogenic FXIa assay, and non-activated partial thromboplastin time (NaPTT) assay. A spiking study in which large quantities of FXIa were added to samples before CEX chromatography was used to examine the robustness of the process to remove FXIa. Western blot and ELISA analyses demonstrated that residual FXIa remained in the intermediate manufacturing products until after CEX chromatography, when it was reduced to undetectable levels. The spiking study demonstrated that CEX chromatography removed &gt;99% of FXI protein and reduced FXI activity to below detection limits, even in samples containing 158-fold greater FXIa levels than that of normal samples. Procoagulant activity in 9 consecutive lots of GC5107 was reduced to below the detection limits of the thrombin generation and chromogenic FXIa assays (&lt;1.56\xe2\x80\x85IU/ml and &lt;0.16\xe2\x80\x85IU/ml, respectively). The NaPTT of &gt;250\xe2\x80\x85s in all 9 lots indicated very low levels of procoagulant activity. We demonstrate that a novel 10% IVIG manufacturing process including CEX chromatography is a robust means of removing FXIa from the final preparation.
