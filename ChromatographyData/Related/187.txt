Title: Facilitated on-line supercritical fluid extraction - supercritical fluid chromatography for nonpolar and polar compounds from milk thistle seeds

Abstract: Plant seeds, as those from milk thistle (Silybum marianum), are a valuable source of nonpolar and polar compounds with potentially interesting biological activity. The main nonpolar compounds are triglycerides, which are also the main components of all vegetable oils. In addition, specific polar compounds â€“ flavonolignans, called silymarin, have been found in large amounts in milk thistle seeds extract. These flavonoids derivatives have different biological activity, for instance hepatoprotective effects. In order to extract and analyze both nonpolar (triglycerides) and polar compounds (flavonolignans) from milk thistle seeds through a sequential methodology, an on-line supercritical fluid extraction - supercritical fluid chromatography (SFE-SFC) method was developed. Different ways of transferring the extracts from SFE to SFC (i.e. direct on-column transfer and loop transfer) were compared, and particularly for their effect on chromatographic quality. In this respect, nonpolar and polar compounds caused different issues, especially as polar compounds required a significant portion of co-solvent in the extraction step, favoring early elution in the chromatographic column. First, on-line SFE-SFC was used for triglycerides analysis and allowed the comparison of transfer modes. Then, on-line kinetics were performed to measure defatting time before polar molecules extraction. Finally, the eventual benefit of loop transfer was also investigated for the analysis of flavonolignans, polar molecules whose analysis can be difficult by on-line SFE-SFC. The aim of this paper is to discuss the versatility of on-line SFE-SFC and how challenging the coupling can be, especially when both non-polar and polar molecules must be analyzed independently in a single sample.
