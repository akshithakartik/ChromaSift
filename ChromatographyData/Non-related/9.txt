Title: Applications and opportunities of click chemistry in plant science

Abstract: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2022 was awarded to the pioneers of Lego-like ‘click chemistry’: combinatorial chemistry with remarkable modularity and diversity. It has been applied to a wide variety of biological systems, from microorganisms to plants and animals, including humans. Although click chemistry is a powerful chemical biology tool, comparatively few studies have examined its potential in plant science. Here, we review click chemistry reactions and their applications in plant systems, highlighting the activity-based probes and metabolic labeling strategies combined with bioorthogonal click chemistry to visualize plant biological processes. These applications offer new opportunities to explore and understand the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating plant composition, growth, metabolism, defense, and immune responses.
