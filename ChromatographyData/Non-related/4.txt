Title: Interfacial radiation chemistry

Abstract: Radiation effects on materials is a key-component when assessing the safety of nuclear technological installations such as nuclear power plants, geological repositories for used nuclear fuel and plants for reprocessing of used nuclear fuel. Besides the effects that some types of ionizing radiation have on bulk properties of solid materials, ionizing radiation absorbed by water in contact with the surface will lead to the production of potentially corrosive species. While homogeneous radiation chemistry of water is well-known, the interfacial radiation chemistry of metals and metal oxides in contact with water is still under exploration. This article discusses the main features of interfacial radiation chemistry using examples from applications in nuclear technology.
