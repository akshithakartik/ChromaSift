Title: Recent advances in the chemistry of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines

Abstract: Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-containing compounds are an important and strategic N-heterocycle family because of their proven applicability and synthetic versatility in preparing relevant chemicals in biological, pharmaceutical, photophysical, material science, and industrial fields. In this way, pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines (PPs) synthesis and functionalization are highly desirable. Various research groups continue to focus on preparing this class of compounds, diversely substituted, to discover new and better applications. As a result, a deep and systematic study of the chemistry and properties of PPs is necessary to understand their behavior in various fields. Therefore, this contribution focuses on some recent and strategic examples regarding: (i) fundamental properties, (ii) synthesis, (iii) reactivity, and (iv) applications of structurally diverse PPs, principally reported in investigations from 2012 to 2022, and some other representative works reported in previous years. The manuscript comprises an introduction section and four discussion sections that begin with the most novel topic, describing the chemistry and properties of the unsubstituted pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine molecule (PP).
