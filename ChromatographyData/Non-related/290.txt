Title: Interfacial Dynamics, Chemistry, and Photochemistry of Molecular Ligands on Plasmonic Nanoparticle Surfaces: Insights From Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy

Abstract: Molecular ligands may exhibit highly dynamic interfacial behaviors and undergo intriguing catalytic and photocatalytic transformations on nanostructured metal surfaces. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy is a unique in situ plasmon-enhanced spectroscopic tool particularly suited for characterizing dynamic molecular events on the surfaces of metallic nanostructures. In this chapter, we discuss how critical insights are extracted from the results of deliberately designed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic measurements to shed light on the complex mechanisms underpinning the dynamic nanoparticle-ligand interactions and the versatile chemistry/photochemistry on plasmonic nanoparticle surfaces.
