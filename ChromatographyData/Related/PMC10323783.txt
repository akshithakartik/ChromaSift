Title: Metabolomic profiling and bactericidal effect of &lt;i&gt;Polyalthia longifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Sonn.) Twaites. stem bark against methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

Abstract: &lt;b&gt;Objective.&lt;/b&gt; The present study was carried out to establish the chemical profile of the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Polyalthia longifolia&lt;/i&gt; stem bark and investigate its antibacterial property against some human pathogenic bacteria. &lt;b&gt;Methods.&lt;/b&gt; The extract was analysed using liquid and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Antibacterial activity of &lt;i&gt;P. longifolia&lt;/i&gt; extract against some human pathogenic bacteria was screened using the AlamarBlue method, and MIC and MBC were determined. &lt;b&gt;Results and Conclusion.&lt;/b&gt; Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed the presence of 21 compounds among which 12 were identified. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) allowed identification of 26 compounds, the three major ones being the following: cis vaccenic acid (17.79\xe2\x80\x8a%), 3-ethyl-3-hydroxyandrostan-17-one (13.80\xe2\x80\x8a%) and copaiferic acid B (12.82\xe2\x80\x8a%). &lt;i&gt;P. longifolia&lt;/i&gt; extract was active against Gram-positive bacteria with MIC ranging from 1 to 2\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and MBC from 2 to 6\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study demonstrated the bactericidal effect of the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Polyalthia longifolia&lt;/i&gt; stem bark against some human pathogenic bacteria, including methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; . This effect could be related to the presence in the extract of a broad diversity of well-known compounds with established pharmacological properties. These results support the ethnomedicinal use of &lt;i&gt;P. longifolia&lt;/i&gt; stem bark in Cameroon for the management of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA)-related infections.
