Title: Critical conditions for liquid chromatography of statistical polyolefins: Evaluation of diene distribution in EPDM terpolymers

Abstract: Liquid chromatography at critical conditions is of interest as it may unravel molecular information on macromolecular structures not accessible by any other analytical techniques. Yet so far, such conditions have never been experimentally established for copolymers, where a particular need for such information exists. Toward this goal, critical conditions for statistical ethylene propylene copolymers were identified. In the first approach the composition of the binary mobile phase was varied at a constant temperature, and secondly by modulating the adsorption-desorption temperature at constant mobile phase composition. Solvents for both methods were identified by using a novel approach that combines structure retention relationships with Hansen Solubility Parameters. As a result, for the first time, the heterogeneity of an ethylene propylene diene terpolymer sample with regard to the pendant double bond of the diene could be determined. The novel chromatographic approach was validated by measuring the composition of fractions taken over the chromatographic run offline by nuclear magnetic resonance. In summary, this work gave the first experimental evidence for the existence of critical conditions for polyolefin random copolymers, as postulated by Brun. This novel chromatographic approach holds immense potential to engineer complex polymers towards future applications by making use of the now-accessible molecular information.
