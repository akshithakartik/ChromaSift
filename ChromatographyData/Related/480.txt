Title: A rapid method for detecting bronopol in fresh fish, shrimp, crab, and shellfish samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry

Abstract: Fish farming plays a vital role in providing food, nutrition, and employment globally. However, this industry faces security challenges, necessitating the use of fungicides and preservatives, such as bronopol, to increase product yields. Bronopol (2‑bromo-2-nitropropan-1,3-diol; CAS:52–51–7) is widely used in various fields, including food production, cosmetics, and, more recently, aquaculture. Currently, there is a limited number of techniques available for detecting bronopol in aquaculture products. This is primarily due to bronopol's instability, susceptibility to degradation, and tendency to form precipitates that pose challenges in extraction from aquaculture products. For this issue, this study presents a comprehensive method for detecting bronopol content in aquaculture tissues using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC‒MS/MS). The methodology was optimized, involving extraction with Cu-Zn precipitant, cleanup using a small HLB column, separation on a T3 column, and gradient elution with water and acetonitrile mobile phases. The quantitative approach was employed without the use of an internal standard, following the external standard method. The spiked recoveries at 3 fortification levels (0.1, 0.2, and 1 mg/kg) ranged from 87.1 % to 108.1 % with relative standard deviations RSD ≤ 9.0 %. By applying this method to fresh fish, shrimp, crab, and shellfish samples from a local supermarket, no residues of bronopol were detected, ensuring the reliability of the results. The simplicity, rapidity, and high sensitivity of the method make it a suitable alternative to conventional techniques for bronopol detection. Moreover, the successful validation of the method's recovery and precision supports its potential application in monitoring and preventing the misuse of bronopol in aquaculture, thereby safeguarding aquaculture product quality and protecting public health.
