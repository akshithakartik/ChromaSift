Title: Chemometric sensing of stereoisomeric compound mixtures with a redox-responsive optical probe.

Abstract: The analysis of mixtures of chiral compounds is a common task in academic and industrial laboratories typically achieved by laborious and time-consuming physical separation of the individual stereoisomers to allow interference-free quantification, for example using chiral chromatography coupled with UV detection. Current practice thus impedes high-throughput and slows down progress in countless chiral compound development projects. Here we describe a chemometric solution to this problem using a redox-responsive naphthoquinone that enables chromatography-free click chemistry sensing of challenging mixtures. The achiral probe covalently binds amino alcohols within a few minutes at room temperature and generates characteristic UV&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and CD&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; spectra that are intentionally altered &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; sodium borohydride reduction to provide a second, strikingly different chiroptical data set (UV&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and CD&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;). Chemometric partial least squares processing of the chiroptical outputs then enables spectral deconvolution and accurate determination of individual analyte concentrations. The success of this approach is demonstrated with 35 samples covering considerably varied total analyte amounts and stereoisomeric ratios. All chemicals and machine learning algorithms are readily available and can be immediately adapted by any laboratory.
