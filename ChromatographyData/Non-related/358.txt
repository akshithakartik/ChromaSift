Title: Role of artificial intelligence in chemistry

Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence is one of the most cited areas in chemistry. Chemistry and Artificial Intelligence are inextricably linked! Artificial Intelligence and Chemistry applications in the healthcare industry are mostly focused on drug discovery and development. With the integration of technology and medicine, drug formulation and production has evolved significantly. Due to the technologically complex technology and equipment employed by scientists, this method has also been a product of improved research and development in the pharmaceutical business. However, the application of artificial intelligence in chemistry is not limited to drug development. It goes beyond molecules and chemical bond building blocks, which are the foundations of science. When it comes to chemistry and related areas, AI can help with everything from molecule synthesis to molecular property identification. In this review article, we tried to provide an overview on how AI assists researchers and scientists in demonstrating their usefulness and applicability in drug developments and delivery processes.
