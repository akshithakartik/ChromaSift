Title: Nucleoside-derived inhibitors of MraY: Medicinal chemistry with natural products

Abstract: MraY is a key enzyme in bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis. It is not addressed by any clinically used antibiotic, thus making it an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial agents without cross resistance to established antimicrobial drugs. Several classes of uridine-derived natural products (“nucleoside antibiotics”) are known to inhibit MraY with remarkable activities. This review presents the most relevant sub-classes of nucleoside antibiotics and reported medicinal chemistry efforts to develop them towards antibacterial drug candidates. The following natural products and their analogues are discussed: (i) muraymycins; (ii) caprazamycins and related compounds; (iii) mureidomycins and related compounds; (iv) capuramycins; and (v) tunicamycins. Overall, we aim to demonstrate that it is perfectly feasible to treat naturally occurring nucleoside antibiotics as “hits” and to employ medicinal chemistry approaches for their structural optimization, even though their structural complexity might be associated with challenging synthetic work. Studies along this line might contribute to efforts towards the development of urgently needed new antibiotics.
