Title: Functional integration of protein A binding ability to antibody fragments for convenient and tag-free purification.

Abstract: Although the development of small therapeutic antibodies is important, the affinity tags used for their purification often result in heterogeneous production and immunogenicity. In this study, we integrated &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; protein A (SpA) binding ability into antibody fragments for convenient and tag-free purification. SpA affinity chromatography is used as a global standard purification method for conventional antibodies owing to its high binding affinity to the Fc region. SpA also has a binding affinity for some variable heavy domains (VH) classified in the VH3 subfamily. Through mutagenesis based on alignment and structural modeling results using the SpA-VH3 cocrystal structure, we integrated the SpA-binding ability into the anti-CD3 single-chain Fv. Furthermore, we applied this mutagenesis approach to more complicated small bispecific antibodies and successfully purified the antibodies using SpA affinity chromatography. The antibodies retained their biological function after purification. Integration of SpA-binding ability into conventional antibody fragments simplifies the purification and monitoring of the production processes and, thus, is an ideal strategy for accelerating the development of small therapeutic antibodies. Furthermore, because of its immunoactivity, the anti-CD3 variable region with SpA-binding ability is an effective building block for developing engineered cancer therapeutic antibodies without the Fc region.
