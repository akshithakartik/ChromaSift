Title: Cytochrome P450 2D6 profiles and anti-relapse efficacy of tafenoquine against &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; in Australian Defence Force personnel.

Abstract: &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; infections and relapses remain a major health problem for malaria-endemic countries, deployed military personnel, and travelers. Presumptive anti-relapse therapy and radical cure using the 8-aminoquinoline drugs primaquine and tafenoquine are necessary to prevent relapses. Although it has been demonstrated that the efficacy of primaquine is associated with Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) activity, there is insufficient data on the role of CYP2D6 in the anti-relapse efficacy of tafenoquine. We investigated the relationship between CYP2D6 activity status and tafenoquine efficacy in preventing &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; relapses retrospectively using plasma samples collected from Australian Defence Force personnel deployed to Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste who participated in clinical trials of tafenoquine during 1999-2001. The CYP2D6 gene was amplified from plasma samples and fully sequenced from 92 participant samples, comprised of relapse (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 31) and non-relapse (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 61) samples, revealing 14 different alleles. CYP2D6 phenotypes deduced from combinations of CYP2D6 alleles predicted that among 92 participants 67, 15, and 10 were normal, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, respectively. The deduced CYP2D6 phenotype did not correlate with the corresponding participant\'s plasma tafenoquine concentrations that were determined in the early 2000s by high-performance liquid chromatography or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the deduced CYP2D6 phenotype did not associate with &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; relapse outcomes. Our results indicate that CYP2D6 does not affect plasma tafenoquine concentrations and the efficacy of tafenoquine in preventing &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; relapses in the assessed Australian Defence Force personnel.
