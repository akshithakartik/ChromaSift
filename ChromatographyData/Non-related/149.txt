Title: Functional lanthanide complexes with N,N′-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-N,N′-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)ethylenediamine (H2bbpen) derivatives: Coordination chemistry, single-molecule magnetism and optical properties

Abstract: Lanthanide complexes are among the most active frontiers of functional coordination chemistry, especially due to their fascinating magnetic and optical properties. Among them, a hexadentate mixed ligand, H2bbpen, gave birth to some of the best lanthanide single-molecule magnets and photoluminescence complexes. Here we review the coordination chemistry, the single-molecule magnetism and the optical properties of H2bbpen-based lanthanide complexes, trying to find some magneto-structural and optical-structural correlations that can promote further developments in such a family and related systems.
