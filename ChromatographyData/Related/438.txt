Title: A method to determine two antibiotics prescribed to treat nosocomial infections in plasma and urine by micellar liquid chromatography

Abstract: Combined prescription of the antimicrobial drugs linezolid and meropenem is a common strategy to treat multidrug-resistant nosocomial infections. We propose an innovative method to determine these two drugs in plasma and urine, based on micellar liquid chromatography. Both biological fluids were diluted in mobile phase, filtered and directly injected, without any extraction step. Using a C18 column and a mobile phase of 0.1 M sodium dodecyl sulfate – 10 % methanol, phosphate buffered at pH 3, running under isocratic mode, both antibiotics were eluted without overlapping in<15 min. Detection was by absorbance: 255 nm for linezolid and 310 nm for meropenem. The influence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and methanol concentration on retention factor was established for both drugs using an interpretative approach assisted by chemometrics. The procedure was successfully validated following the guidelines of 2018 Bioanalytical Method Validation Guidance for Industry in terms of: linearity (determination coefficients over 0.99990), calibration range (1 – 50 mg/L), instrumental and method sensitivity, trueness (bias of −10.8 to + 2.4%), precision (relative standard deviation of < 10.2%), dilution integrity, carry-over effect, robustness and stability. It should be emphasized that the method uses low volumes of toxic and volatile solvents and can be achieved in a short period. The procedure was found useful for routine analysis, as it was cost-affordable, more eco-friendly and safer than hydroorganic HPLC, easy-to-handle and highly sample-throughput. Finally, it was applied to incurred samples of patients taking this medication.
