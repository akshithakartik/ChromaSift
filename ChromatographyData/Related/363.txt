Title: Industrial Applications of Asymmetric Synthesis in a Medicinal Chemistry Setting

Abstract: In the first edition of Comprehensive Chirality, the volume on Industrial Applications of Asymmetric Synthesis covered primarily process chemistry developments with only sparse mention of medicinal chemistry applications. In the subsequent decade, increased emphasis has been placed on excellence in synthesis as a competitive advantage in drug discovery. This emphasis has been accompanied by more widespread utilization of fit-for-purpose asymmetric synthesis methods to accelerate the design-synthesis-data cycle in medicinal chemistry. Case studies from Merck, AbbVie, and Pfizer demonstrate effective asymmetric method discovery and application in a medicinal chemistry setting. These case studies demonstrate acceleration of structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies via creation of key chiral intermediates/building blocks, invention of new bond construction tactics and library enumeration tools, and removal of time-consuming reliance on chiral chromatography. Furthermore, transition to process chemistry is facilitated via earlier investment in efficient asymmetric syntheses which often creates more scalable routes to drug candidates. Collaboration with academic groups and process chemistry colleagues characterizes many of these efforts. Ultimately, earlier focus on asymmetric synthesis expedites the path to new chiral drugs to help patients who need them.
