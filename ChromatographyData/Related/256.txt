Title: Polybutylene terephthalate-based stationary phase for ion-pair-free reversed-phase liquid chromatography of small interfering RNA. Part 1: Direct coupling with mass spectrometry

Abstract: Nowadays, ion-pairing reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC) is the dominating generic method for the analysis of nucleic acid related compounds, such as antisense-oligonucleotides (ASO), small-interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) or other DNA or RNA type molecules and their conjugates. Despite of its effective performance, the usage of a high concentration of ion-pairing reagent in the eluent in IP-RPLC is unfavorable for the hyphenation with mass spectrometry (MS) which is required for a detailed structural characterization of the analytes and their structurally related impurities. In this work, we tested a polybutylene terephthalate (PBT)-bonded silica-based stationary phase for the separation of generically synthesized Patisiran as siRNA (antisense and sense single strands as well as their annealed double strand) giving some unexpected selectivity without any presence of ion-pairing reagents. Important chromatographic conditions affecting the separation have been investigated and evaluated. Furthermore, MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) characterization was possible without contamination of the MS system with ion-pair agent and related problems.
