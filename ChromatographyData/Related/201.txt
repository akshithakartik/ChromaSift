Title: Coupling an ion chromatography to high resolution mass spectrometry (IC-MS) for the discovery of potentially prebiotic oligosaccharides in Chardonnay grape marc

Abstract: Oligosaccharides are carbohydrates made of three to twenty monosaccharide units linked through glycosidic bonds. Emerging research into the potential prebiotic activity of oligosaccharides is creating opportunities to use industrial byproducts as value-added products. Grape marc is a residue left after winemaking and has been shown to provide health benefits to humans. In this study, we analyzed the oligosaccharides in Chardonnay grape marc by utilizing a hyphenated platform in which an ion chromatography (IC) system is coupled to an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (MS). With this platform, we obtained a structural library including 32 oligosaccharides with unique compositions of monosaccharides and 61 oligosaccharide structures. Notably, the ion chromatographic separation provided resolution of charged isomers while maintaining separation capacity for small, neutral oligosaccharides. High-quality tandem MS also facilitated the identification of oligosaccharides with structural modifications including methylation and the presence of sugar alditols and hexuronic acids. The data acquired by the IC-MS system were also compared with previously published LC-MS data. We found that these two platforms are largely complementary and, in combination, provide a more comprehensive characterization of oligosaccharides than either platform achieves alone.
