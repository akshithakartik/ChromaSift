Title: The Separation, Purification, Structure Identification, and Antioxidant Activity of &lt;i&gt;Elaeagnus umbellata&lt;/i&gt; Polysaccharides.

Abstract: In order to investigate the antioxidant activity of &lt;i&gt;Elaeagnus umbellata&lt;/i&gt; polysaccharides, the physicochemical characteristics of purified &lt;i&gt;Elaeagnus umbellata&lt;/i&gt; polysaccharides (EUP, consisting of two fractions, EUP1 and EUP2) were investigated using UV spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). This revealed that EUP1 and EUP2 were acidic polysaccharides with an average molecular weight (MW) of 63 and 38 kDa, respectively. EUP1 mainly consisted of L-rhamnose and D-galactose in a molar ratio of 2.05:1, and EUP2 consisted of D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-galactose, and D-arabinose in a molar ratio of 2.06:1:2.78:1. Furthermore, EUP exhibited considerable antioxidant potential for scavenging hydroxyl, superoxide anion, DPPH, and ABTS radicals. Therefore, EUP can be developed as a potential antioxidant for the functional food or pharmaceutical field.
