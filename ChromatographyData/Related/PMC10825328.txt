Title: Relationship between phospholipid molecules species and volatile compounds in grilled lambs during the heating process.

Abstract: The present study used a comprehensive analysis combining headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) to investigate changes in volatile compounds and phospholipid molecules in grilled lambs. The results revealed 19 key volatile compounds (OAV\xc2\xa0&gt;\xc2\xa01) involved in the grilling process of lambs. Additionally, UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis detected 142 phospholipid molecules in grilled lamb, with phosphatidylcholine exhibiting the highest content (36.62\xc2\xa0%), followed by phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidyl glycerol, and phosphatidic acid. Through partial least squares analysis, 63 key differential phospholipids were identified. Principal component analysis of the key differential phospholipids and volatile compounds indicated that phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidyl ethanolamine phospholipids are the key substrates in forming volatile compounds in grilled lambs. This information is essential for precisely regulating the flavor profile, enhancing the grilling process, and minimizing the production of harmful compounds in grilled meat products.
