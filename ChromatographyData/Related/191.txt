Title: Surrogate-based optimization of capture chromatography platforms for the improvement of computational efficiency

Abstract: In this work, we discuss the use of surrogate functions and a new optimization framework to create an efficient and robust computational framework for process design. Our model process is the capture chromatography unit operation for monoclonal antibody purification, an important step in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Simulating this unit operation involves solving a system of non-linear partial differential equations, which can have high computational cost. We implemented surrogate functions to reduce the computational time and make the framework more attractive for industrial applications. This strategy yielded accurate results with a 93% decrease in processing time. Additionally, we developed a new optimization framework to reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a solution to the optimization problem. We demonstrate the performance of our new framework, which uses MATLAB built-in tools, by comparing its performance against individual optimization algorithms for problems with integer, continuous, and mixed-integer variables.
