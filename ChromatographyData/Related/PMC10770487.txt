Title: Understanding intentionally and non-intentionally added substances and associated threshold of toxicological concern in post-consumer polyolefin for use as food packaging materials.

Abstract: The use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) polymers in food contact materials (FCMs) can facilitate achieving a circular economy by reducing environmental waste and landfill accumulation. This study aimed to identify potentially harmful substances, including non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) and unapproved intentionally added substances (IAS), in polyolefin samples from material recovery facilities using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry. Selected phthalates and bisphenols were quantified by targeted gas-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. The analysis detected 9 compounds in virgin polymers and 52 different compounds including alcohols, hydrocarbons, phenols in virgin and hydrocarbons, aromatic, phthalates, organic acids, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in PCR polymers. The Cramer classification system was used to assesses the Threshold of Toxicological Concern associated with the detected compounds. The PCR sample showed a slightly higher proportion of Cramer Class III compounds (48.08\xc2\xa0%) than the virgin sample (44.44\xc2\xa0%), indicating higher toxicity potential. Quantification detected bisphenols only in PCR material including BPA (2.88\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.53\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g), BPS (5.12\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.003\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g), BPF (3.42\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.01\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g), and BADGE (4.638\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g). Phthalate concentrations were higher in PCR than virgin samples, with the highest levels detected as DIDP, at 6.18\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.31\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g for PCR and 6.04\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.02 for virgin. This study provides critical understanding of the safety and potential risks associated with using PCR polyolefins from different sources in food contact applications.
