Title: Chromatography Equipment and Resins

Abstract: Until relatively recently, process chromatography has been used, almost exclusively, in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries for the manufacture of protein therapeutics (e.g., vaccines, antibodies). Over the past 40â€“50 years, facilitated by advances in the chromatographic process (e.g., cost reductions) and chromatography resin performance (e.g., capacity, resilience), the situation has changed leading to dairy products such as lactoferrin, glycomacropeptide, and whey protein isolate being routinely manufactured using process chromatography. These advances in process chromatography have led to the more widespread application of the technology in the dairy processing industry. This article outlines the basic principles of the design, operation, performance testing, and selection of chromatography equipment and resins with dairy applications as the focus. Non-protein dairy ingredients, such as lactose and minerals, cannot support the cost of chromatography, so the focus is strictly on dairy proteins as illustrative examples of the basic principles of chromatography.
