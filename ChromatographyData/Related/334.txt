Abstract: Consistent retention time (t

                        R
                      variations from the reversed-phase UPLC-MS, we developed an endogenous retention-index (endoRI) using in-sample straight-chain acylcarnitines with different chain-length (L

                      variations caused by the combined changes of mobile phases, gradients, flow-rates, elution time, columns and temperature from up to 5.1 min–0.2 min for most metabolites in a model metabolome consisting of 91 metabolites and multiple biological matrices including human serum, plasma, fecal, urine, A549 cells and rabbit liver extracts. The endoRI-corrections also reduced the inter-batch and inter-platform t

                      variations from 1.5 min to 0.15 min for 95 % of detected features in the above biological samples. We further established a quantitative model between t
