Title: Insights into surface chemistry induced powder layer characteristic evolutions in additive manufacturing

Abstract: Compared with large amount of work on the powder layer characteristics in powder-bed-based additive manufacturing (AM) under different operating conditions and powder properties, the significant effects of powder surface chemistry on the quality of the powder layer were less investigated. To further enhance people's insights in this aspect so as to obtain superior powder layer for subsequent process, Ti-6Al-4Â V powders with different surface chemistries (e.g., the as received powder without any treatment, the moistened powder with surface H2O molecule, the exsiccated powder with grown nano-scaled oxides film) were firstly prepared, where the surface chemistry state of each powder was characterized and corresponding flowability and spreadability were measured in physical experiments. On this basis, systematic numerical investigations on the evolution of different surface chemistry induced powder layer characteristics during spreading were conducted. The results demonstrate that the surface moistened powder would deteriorate powder layer quality due to the strong cohesion effect between particles. However, the increase of the surface roughness on exsiccated powder could facilitate a greater deposition rate compared to that of the as-received powder during spreading, and therefore result in a powder layer with more pronounced apparent density. The mechanism lies in that high friction from the rough surface film could restrict the scattered motion behavior of sticky particles caused by the breakdown of cluster structure during the blade movement, and thus facilitate the most prominent deposition rate of this kind of particles during spreading. Nevertheless, the simultaneous increase of interactions within exsiccated powder also diminishes the boundary effect with blade and substrate, resulting in abnormal elevation of powder layer thickness, enlargement of internal pore volume, and depressed packing fraction correspondingly. Consequently, the powder with grown surface film is not ideal for printing, and the chemical reactions on powder that causes intensive film roughness should be prevented in powder storage and treatment process.
