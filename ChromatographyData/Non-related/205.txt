Title: Evolution of chemistry and selection technology for DNA-encoded library

Abstract: DNA-encoded chemical library (DEL) links the power of amplifiable genetics and the non-self-replicating chemical phenotypes, generating a diverse chemical world. In analogy with the biological world, the DEL world can evolve by using a chemical central dogma, wherein DNA replicates using the PCR reactions to amplify the genetic codes, DNA sequencing transcripts the genetic information, and DNA-compatible synthesis translates into chemical phenotypes. Importantly, DNA-compatible synthesis is the key to expanding the DEL chemical space. Besides, the evolution-driven selection system pushes the chemicals to evolve under the selective pressure, i.e., desired selection strategies. In this perspective, we summarized recent advances in expanding DEL synthetic toolbox and panning strategies, which will shed light on the drug discovery harnessing inÂ vitro evolution of chemicals via DEL.
