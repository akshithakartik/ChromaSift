Title: Typical Aroma of Merlot Dry Red Wine from Eastern Foothill of Helan Mountain in Ningxia, China.

Abstract: Aroma is an important aspect of wine quality and consumer appreciation. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and olfactory profiles of Merlot dry red wines from the Eastern Foothill of Helan Mountain (EFHM) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantitative descriptive analysis. The results showed that Merlot wines from EFHM were characterized by intense flavors of drupe and tropical fruits compared with the Gansu region. Nineteen VOCs were defined as essential compounds contributing to the aroma characteristics of the Merlot wines through gas chromatography-olfactometry/mass spectrometry and odor activity value analysis. Predominantly, geranyl isovalerate, which contributed to the herbal odors of the Merlot wines, was detected in the grape wine of EFHM for the first time. The addition experiment revealed that geranyl isovalerate influenced the aroma quality of wine by increasing herbal odors and enhancing the olfactory intensities of tropical fruits. These results are helpful for further understanding the aroma of Merlot wines from EFHM and improving the quality of wine aromas.
