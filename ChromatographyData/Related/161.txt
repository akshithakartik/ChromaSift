Title: Microflow liquid chromatography â€“ multi-emitter nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry of oligonucleotides

Abstract: While the most sensitive LC-MS methods for oligonucleotide analysis contain ion-pairs in the mobile phase, these modifiers have been associated with instrument contamination and ion suppression. Typically, entire LC-MS systems are reserved for oligonucleotide LC-MS when using ion-pairing buffers. To overcome these limitations, numerous HILIC methods, liberated from ion-pairs, have been recently developed. Since ion-pairs play a role in analyte desorption from ESI droplets, their removal from mobile phases tend to impact method sensitivity. An effective way to recover MS sensitivity is to reduce the LC flow rate and therefore reduce ESI droplet size. With a focus on MS sensitivity, this study investigates the applicability of a microflow LC- nanoelectrospray MS platform in oligonucleotide ion-pair RP and HILIC LC-MS methods. The platform is effective and substantially increased the MS sensitivity of HILIC methods. Furthermore, LC method development for both types of separations provide insight into microflow chromatography of oligonucleotides, an under investigated chromatographic scale.
