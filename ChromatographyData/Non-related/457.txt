Title: Sub-grid scale turbulent micro-mixing with infinitely fast chemistry in the context of fire modelling

Abstract: Combustion modelling with the Eddy Dissipation Model (EDM) requires closure of the mixing time between fuel and oxidizer occurring on a sgs level. Six different models for estimating the micro-mixing times, in the context of fire modelling, are investigated: (1) equal to a constant fraction of the integral time scale (i.e., default EDM approach); (2) allow for this fraction to vary in space and time as a function of the standard deviation of the mixture fraction; (3) use of the geometric mean of the integral time scale and the Kolmogorov time scale; (4) use of the geometric mean of the sub-grid velocity stretching time and the Kolmogorov time scale; (5) calculation of the mixing time scale based on the local variation of the scalar dissipation rate and the mixture fraction variance; (6) use of the minimum of the mixing times for diffusion, sub-grid scale advection and buoyant acceleration. Overall, the performance of all models on fine grids is comparable. However, models 2 and 6 perform better for all the grid sizes and test cases considered. Model 1 predicts the highest temperatures, the performance of models 3 and 4 is similar while the predictions with model 5 are highly grid-dependent.
