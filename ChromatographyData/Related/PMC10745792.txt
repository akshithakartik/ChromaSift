Title: Post-Chromatographic Derivatization Coupled with Mass Spectrometry as a Method of Profiling and Identification of Antioxidants; &lt;i&gt;Ligustrum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; Phytocomplex as an Example.

Abstract: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) coupled with radical scavenging assays, such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2\'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) can be both used for the detection of the antioxidants in plant extracts. In this study, the ethanolic (70% &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) extracts from different morphological parts of &lt;i&gt;Ligustrum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; collected at different stages of maturity were used as the source of antioxidants. The final identification of antioxidants was performed using high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS). As a result, 19 compounds with antioxidant properties detected with HPLC-ABTS assay and 10 compounds detected with HPTLC-DPPH/ABTS assay were identified, mostly from the group of iridoids, phenylethanoids, and flavonoids. When comparing different &lt;i&gt;L. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; samples, it was found that the extracts obtained from leaves contained the greatest number of antioxidants. The results of this study suggest that HPTLC-DPPH/ABTS as well as HPLC-ABTS derivatization coupled with the HRMS can be successfully used for profiling and identification of antioxidants from natural sources. Planar chromatography is more suitable for screening multiple samples because of its simplicity, whereas more challenging liquid chromatography provides more detailed information and is therefore better for a selected set of samples.
