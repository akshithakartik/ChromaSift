Title: Improving the performances of direct-current triboelectric nanogenerators with surface chemistry

Abstract: Over the past decade, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) – small and portable devices designed to harvest electricity from mechanical vibrations and friction – have matured from a niche theme of electrical engineering research into multidisciplinary research encompassing materials science, physics, and chemistry. Recent advances in both the fundamental understanding and performances of TENGs have been made possible by surface chemistry, electrochemistry, and theoretical chemistry research entering this active and promising field. This short review focuses on the recent developments of direct-current (DC) TENGs, where sliding friction or repetitive contact–separation cycles between the surface of polymers, metals, chemically modified semiconductors, and more recently even by the simple contact of surfaces with water solutions, can output DC suitable to power electronic devices without the need of additional rectification. We critically analyze the role of surface chemistry toward maximizing DC TENG outputs and device longevity. The major current hypotheses about their working mechanism(s) are also discussed.
