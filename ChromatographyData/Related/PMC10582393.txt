Title: Response surface methodology-optimized extraction of flavonoids from pomelo peels and isolation of naringin with antioxidant activities by Sephadex LH20 gel chromatography.

Abstract: In this study, flavonoids were extracted from pomelo peels and naringin was isolated from the flavonoid extract. The effects of extraction parameters, namely, ethanol concentration, solid-to-liquid ratio, and extraction time, on the yield of flavonoids extracted from pomelo peels were analyzed according to the Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology. The experimental conditions for flavonoid extraction were optimized, and naringin was separated from the extracted flavonoids using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. Experimental results showed that the influence of factors on the extraction rate of flavonoids from pomelo peels was in the order of ethanol concentration\xc2\xa0&gt;\xc2\xa0solid-to-liquid ratio\xc2\xa0&gt;\xc2\xa0extraction time, and the optimal extraction parameters were 85% ethanol concentration, 1:20 solid-to-liquid ratio, and 4-h extraction time for extracting flavonoids from pomelo peels. Under these conditions, the yield of flavonoids was 6.07\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.06\xc2\xa0mg/g. After three times of extraction, the flavonoid extraction rate reached 96.55%, and the residual naringin in the pomelo peels was 0.017\xc2\xa0mg/g, at which point the bitterness in the pomelo peels disappeared. Two components, namely, PF1 and PF2, were separated from the crude flavonoid of pomelo peels through Sephadex LH20 column chromatography. PF2 was identified as naringin by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, with a purity of 95.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.23%. Both flavonoids and PF2 exhibited good in vitro radicals scavenging activities on DPPH, ABTS, superoxide anion and hydroxyl.
