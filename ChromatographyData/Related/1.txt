Title: Two-dimensional chromatography for the analysis of valorisable biowaste: A review

Abstract: Various everyday areas such as agriculture, wood industry, and wastewater treatment yield residual biowastes in large amounts that can be utilised for the purpose of sustainability and circular economy. Depending on the type of biowaste, they can be used to extract valuable chemicals or converted into alternative fuels. However, for efficient valorisation, these processes need to be monitored, for which thorough chemical characterisation can be highly beneficial. For this aim, two-dimensional (2D) chromatography can be favourable, as it has a higher peak capacity and sensitivity than one-dimensional (1D) chromatography. Therefore, here we review the studies published since 2010 involving gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) as one of the dimensions.
                  For the first time, we present the 2D chromatographic characterisation of various biowastes valorised for different purposes (chemical, fuels), together with future prospects and challenges. The aspects related to the 2D chromatographic analysis of polar, poorly volatile, and thermally unstable compounds are highlighted. In addition, it is demonstrated how different 2D setups can be applied for monitoring the biowaste conversion processes.
