Title: The Impact of the Foliar Application of Amino Acid Aqueous Fertilizer on the Flavor of Potato Tubers.

Abstract: The quality of the flavor of potatoes is a crucial determinant in the commercial success of a potato variety. Plant nutrition promotes the synthesis of amino acids, and the application of exogenous amino acids has the potential to enhance the flavor quality of potatoes. In this experiment, Dian Shu 1418 and Dian Shu 23 were used as the materials, and different amino acid foliar spray trials were designed. The free amino acid content in potato tubers is determined based on high-performance liquid chromatography, and volatile tuber flavor compounds are detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that the amino acid foliar spray effectively increased the content of glycine, methionine, and phenylalanine in the tubers, subsequently increasing the levels of 2,3-dimethyl-pyrazine and 2-ethyl-3-methyl-pyrazine, enhancing the roasted fragrance characteristics of the potatoes. The experimental results provide a reference for cultivating flavor enhancement in potato tubers.
