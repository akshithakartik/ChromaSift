Title: A new MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 cell membrane chromatography analysis model based on HALO-tag technology and its applications

Abstract: Cell membrane chromatography (CMC) is an effective method for studying receptors with multiple transmembrane structure such as MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MrgX2). CMC relies on the maintenance of the complete biological structure of a membrane receptor; however, it needs to be further improved to obtain a more convenient and stable CMC model. In the present study, the haloalkane dehalogenase protein tag (HALO-tag) technology was used to construct a new MrgX2/CMC model. The fusion receptors of MrgX2 with HALO-tag at the C terminus were expressed in HEK293 cells. The silica gel was modified with a substrate of HALO-tag (chloroalkanes) via one-step acylation for the rapid capture of fusion receptors. The new CMC model (MrgX2-HALO-tag/CMC model) was not only quicker to prepare but also more stable and had a longer lifespan than a previous MrgX2-SNAP-tag/CMC model. In combination with the high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) system, the MrgX2-HALO-tag/CMC model was used to screen and identify bioactive components in traditional Chinese medicine. Using this combination, sanggenon C and morusin were identified from Mori Cortex as anti-pseudo-allergic components. The MrgX2-HALO-tag/CMC model alone was also applied to analyze ligand–receptor interaction. The affinity order of four ligands to MrgX2 was as follows: desipramine < imipramine < amitriptyline < clomipramine. This was consistent with the results obtained using the MrgX2-SNAP-tag/CMC model. The MrgX2-HALO-tag/CMC model provides ideas and application prospects for the immobilization of cell membrane that contains receptors with more transmembrane structures.
