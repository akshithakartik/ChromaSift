Title: A computationally efficient approach for soot modeling with discrete sectional method and FGM chemistry

Abstract: A novel approach for the prediction of soot formation in combustion simulations within the framework of discrete sectional method (DSM) based univariate soot model and Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) chemistry, referred to as FGM-CDSM, is proposed in this study. The FGM-CDSM considers the clustering of soot sections derived from the original soot particle size distribution function (PSDF) to minimize the computational cost. Unlike conventional DSM, in FGM-CDSM, governing equations for soot mass fractions are solved for the clusters, by using a pre-computed lookup table with tabulated soot source terms from the flamelet manifold, while the original soot PSDF is re-constructed in a post-processing stage. The flamelets employed for the manifold are computed with detailed chemistry and the complete sectional soot model. A comparative assessment of FGM-CDSM is conducted in laminar diffusion flames for its accuracy and computational performance against the detailed kinetics-based classical sectional model. Numerical results reveal that the FGM-CDSM can favorably reproduce the global soot quantities and capture their dynamic response predicted by detailed kinetics with a good qualitative agreement. Furthermore, compared to detailed kinetics, FGM-CDSM is shown to substantially reduce the computational cost of the complete reacting flow simulation with soot particle transport. Primarily, the use of FGM reduces the overall calculation by about two orders of magnitude compared to detailed kinetics, which is advanced further with the clustering of sections at a low memory footprint. Therefore, the present work demonstrates the promising capabilities of FGM-CDSM in the context of computationally efficient soot calculations and provides an excellent framework for extending its application to the simulations of turbulent sooting flames.
