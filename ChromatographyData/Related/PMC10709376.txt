Title: Rapid Raman spectroscopic identification of three homoisoflavanones in polygonatum odoratum based on twice chromatography derivatization.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to establish a new method for the determination of homoisoflavanones (\xe2\x85\xa2, \xe2\x85\xa3, V) in polygonatum odoratum(POD) by combination of thin layer chromatography (TLC) and chemical derivative resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS). The twice chromatography method of TLC was used to improve the specificity of the component to be tested; the method of the relative Rf was used to reduce the use of the reference substance of the component to be tested; the chemical derivatization method was used to improve the signal intensity of Raman spectrum for the component to be tested in POD, so as to obtain a trace amount fingerprint structure information of the measured component. The method exhibits robust specificity, high sensitivity, and reliable stability, there by offering a novel reference approach for the identification and evaluation of homoisoflavanones (\xe2\x85\xa2, \xe2\x85\xa3, V) in POD.
