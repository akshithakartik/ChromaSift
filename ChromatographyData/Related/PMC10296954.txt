Title: Comparative Analysis of Two &lt;i&gt;Candida parapsilosis&lt;/i&gt; Isolates Originating from the Same Patient Harbouring the Y132F and R398I Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;ERG11&lt;/i&gt; Gene.

Abstract: This work presents a comparative analysis of two clinical isolates of &lt;i&gt;C. parapsilosis&lt;/i&gt;, isolated from haemoculture (HC) and central venous catheter (CVC). Both strains harboured Y132F and R398I mutations in the gene &lt;i&gt;ERG11&lt;/i&gt; associated with resistance to fluconazole (FLC). Differences between the HC and CVC isolates were addressed in terms of virulence, resistance to FLC, and lipid distribution. Expression of the &lt;i&gt;ERG6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ERG9&lt;/i&gt; genes, lipid analysis, fatty acid composition, and lipase activity were assessed via qPCR, thin-layer chromatography/high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and spectrophotometry, respectively. Regulation of the &lt;i&gt;ERG6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ERG9&lt;/i&gt; genes did not prove any impact on FLC resistance. Analysis of lipid metabolism showed a higher accumulation of lanosterol in both the isolates regardless of FLC presence. Additionally, a decreased level of triacylglycerols (TAG) with an impact on the composition of total fatty acids (FA) was observed for both isolates. The direct impact of the &lt;i&gt;ERG11&lt;/i&gt; mutations on lipid/FA analysis has not been confirmed. The higher lipase activity observed for &lt;i&gt;C. parapsilosis&lt;/i&gt; HC isolate could be correlated with the significantly decreased level of TAG. The very close relatedness between both the isolates suggests that one isolate was derived from another after the initial infection of the host.
