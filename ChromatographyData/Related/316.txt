Title: A new secondary metabolite profiling of the lichen Diploschistes diacapsis using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry

Abstract: Lichens are completely acknowledged for their special compounds and many uses in food, medicine, and cosmetics. By using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), we concentrated on the chemistry of Diploschistes diacapsis (Ach.) Lumbsch in an acetone extract for the current study. Seven D. diacapsis lichen species compounds were tentatively discovered in the first investigation employing LC-MS/MS as a precise analysis. Four depsides, one depsidone, one tridepside, and one monocyclic phenol were examined based on the structure of the detected compounds. The method of maceration proved effective and simple for lichen extraction. Our findings from the LC-MS/MS study of lichen compounds from the species D. diacapsis can assist explain and complete the flora data.
                  Additionally, it can improve the mass spectrometry library information. This knowledge could serve as the foundation for biological and pharmacological studies because each lichen metabolite has potential therapeutic benefits.
