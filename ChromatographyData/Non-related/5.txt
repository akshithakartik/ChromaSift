Title: Unveiling extracellular matrix assembly: Insights and approaches through bioorthogonal chemistry

Abstract: Visualizing cells, tissues, and their components specifically without interference with cellular functions, such as biochemical reactions, and cellular viability remains important for biomedical researchers worldwide. For an improved understanding of disease progression, tissue formation during development, and tissue regeneration, labeling extracellular matrix (ECM) components secreted by cells persists is required. Bioorthogonal chemistry approaches offer solutions to visualizing and labeling ECM constituents without interfering with other chemical or biological events. Although biorthogonal chemistry has been studied extensively for several applications, this review summarizes the recent advancements in using biorthogonal chemistry specifically for metabolic labeling and visualization of ECM proteins and glycosaminoglycans that are secreted by cells and living tissues. Challenges, limitations, and future directions surrounding biorthogonal chemistry involved in the labeling of ECM components are discussed. Finally, potential solutions for improvements to biorthogonal chemical approaches are suggested. This would provide theoretical guidance for labeling and visualization of de novo proteins and polysaccharides present in ECM that are cell-secreted for example during tissue remodeling or in vitro differentiation of stem cells.
