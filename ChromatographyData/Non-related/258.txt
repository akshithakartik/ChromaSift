Title: Influence of silane interfacial chemistry on the curing process of anionic Polyamide 6 in glass reinforced composites

Abstract: The manufacturing of composites based on reactive thermoplastic polyamide 6 (PA6), reinforced with glass particles or fibers for structural applications, is quite sensitive to the state of the interface. Surface hydroxyls present at the glass surface can completely inhibit both the PA6 polymerization and crystallization processes. Care must then be exerted when tuning the interfacial chemistry in this system. This work demonstrates how an adequate choice of silane coupling agent, combined with a precise surface grafting methodology and tight control of hydroxyl groups density on glass particulates, yields kinetics and degrees of polymerization and crystallization comparable to the pure PA6 resin. Various silanes were grafted onto the microparticles and their surfaces were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, confocal laser scanning microscopy and contact angle measurements. The activator was also grafted onto the glass surface to initiate polymerization directly from the surface. The results showed that all treated glass particles surfaces allowed obtaining a high degree of conversion but with varying polymerization and crystallization kinetics. The results provide fundamental information on the role of the surface chemistry of glass reinforcements on the polymerization and crystallization of PA6, which are essential for the proper control of composite manufacturing.
