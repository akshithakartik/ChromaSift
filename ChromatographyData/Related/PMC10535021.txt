Title: Liquid Chromatography Methods for Analysis of mRNA Poly(A) Tail Length and Heterogeneity.

Abstract: Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a new class of therapeutic compounds. The current advances in mRNA technology require the development of efficient analytical methods. In this work, we describe the development of several methods for measurement of mRNA poly(A) tail length and heterogeneity. Poly(A) tail was first cleaved from mRNA with the RNase T1 enzyme. The average length of a liberated poly(A) tail was analyzed with the size exclusion chromatography method. Size heterogeneity of the poly(A) tail was estimated with high-resolution ion-pair reversed phase liquid chromatography (IP RP LC). The IP RP LC method provides resolution of poly(A) tail oligonucleotide variants up to 150 nucleotide long. Both methods use a robust ultraviolet detection suitable for mRNA analysis in quality control laboratories. The results were confirmed by the LC-mass spectrometry (LC MS) analysis of the same mRNA sample. The poly(A) tail length and heterogeneity results were in good agreement.
