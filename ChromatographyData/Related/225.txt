Title: Azinphos-methyl and chlorfenvinphos pesticides determination using fabric phase sorptive extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector

Abstract: A reliable and efficient fabric phase sorptive extraction method was developed for the rapid analysis of azinphos-methyl and chlorfenvinphos pesticide residues in wastewater and fruit juice samples using high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector. The influences of major experimental parameters were evaluated and optimized. Relative standard deviation values at two different concentrations (50 and 100 µg L–1) for intra–day (n = 6) and inter–day (n = 4) precisions were less than 8%. Limits of detection for azinphos-methyl and chlorfenvinphos were calculated as 0.96 µg L–1 and 2.5 µg L–1, respectively. The values of the enrichment factors for azinphos-methyl and chlorfenvinphos were calculated as 71 and 73, respectively. The developed analytical method has been allowed simple, specific, accurate and sensitive simultaneous determination of azinphos-methyl and chlorfenvinphos. Additionally, the superior performances and operational simplicity of fabric phase sorptive extraction method have been demonstrated by analyzing the selected pesticide residues in wastewater as well as in carrot, apple, peach, apricot, and orange juice samples.
