Title: 13.12 High-Throughput Experimentation in Organometallic Chemistry and Catalysis

Abstract: The application of high-throughput experimentation to problems in organometallic chemistry and catalysis from 2006 to 2020 is reviewed. Particular focus is given to the evolution of high-throughput approaches in the field, including experimental design, workflows, equipment, and advances in data analysis. This is followed by a comprehensive overview of catalytic reactions studied by high-throughput methods categorized by reaction type. Key applications include, but are not limited to, asymmetric hydrogenation, cross-coupling for CC, CN, and CO bond formation, and alkene polymerization. Emphasis in discussion is given to research that significantly contributes to innovation in high-throughput methods, organometallic chemistry/catalysis, or both.
