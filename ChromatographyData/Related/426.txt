Title: Two peak elution behavior of a monoclonal antibody in cation exchange chromatography as a screening tool for excipients

Abstract: Aggregation of proteins is a critical quality attribute and a major concern during the purification of therapeutic proteins, like monoclonal antibodies. In-solution experiments applying different stress scenarios, e.g., mechanical, or physical stresses, can determine the overall conformational stability of the protein to enhance drug product shelf-life. Several groups have reported surface-induced unfolding and aggregation of monoclonal antibodies and their derivatives during cation exchange chromatography, which results in a two-peak elution behavior of the protein and its species. We have investigated universal influencing factors, like temperature and hold time, on this phenomenon. The formation of the second peak is a kinetic process, which is strongly influenced by temperature during the hold time. However, our main focus was the application of excipients and their influence on the two-peak elution behavior. We compared the on-column screening results with results obtained through a “traditional” in-solution screening using nanoDSF. Mostly, stabilizing excipients, like Sucrose, show their stabilizing abilities in both systems, but some discrepancies, e.g., using Arginine, between the two orthogonal techniques show the potential of the on-column screening system to lead to unexpected results, which would not necessarily be visible in in-solution experiments.
