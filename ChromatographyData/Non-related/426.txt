Title: Sulfur chemistry on the surface ice of Europa

Abstract: Because Europa is embedded in Jupiter's magnetosphere, Europa's crust, which is mainly made of water ice, is continuously bombarded by energetic ions and electrons. The bombardment of the energetic particles not only sputters and dissociates water molecules on Europa's surface but also introduces impurities to its surface ice. Especially, sulfur ions deliver sulfur to the ice, which induces further chemical reactions in the ice and leads to the formation of sulfur-containing species. Observational and experimental studies have shown that sulfuric acid is formed from the sulfur ion implantation on ice. However, the sulfur chemistry on the surface ice of Europa is still poorly understood. In this study, we use a chemical-transport model to simulate chemical processes occurring in the surface ice of Europa during irradiation by ions and electrons. We show that sulfuric acid is the dominant species on the surface ice of Europa, whose mixing ratio may be as high as several percent in the first 100 μm of the ice. We also find that sulfur chemistry may play an important role in the formation of O2 on the surface ice of Europa. The results of our model can be used to estimate the transport rate of the key species (e.g., O2, H2O2, H2SO4) from Europa's surface ice to its subsurface ocean.
