Title: Identification of animal species by nucleic acid chromatography of hair samples and investigation of its applicability to human biological samples

Abstract: GeneFields®-Hair is a simple analysis kit that uses nucleic acid chromatography and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify animal species of hair-like food contaminants. In this study, we evaluated GeneFields®-Hair as a simple and rapid method for identifying animal species from hair-like materials collected in forensic science, such as at crime scenes. The use of this kit with other human biological materials (whole blood, head dandruff, nails, saliva, oral mucosa, sebum, and urine) was also investigated. Animal body hair samples were pretreated by grinding in a buffer solution, centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for PCR. Nucleic acid chromatography of the PCR products allowed the identification of the animal species by the presence or absence of coloration on the decision line. For human biological materials, nucleic acid chromatography was performed after the appropriate pretreatment like body hair material. The determination of some animal species was difficult, even if they had a dedicated DNA Strip determination line. Furthermore, animals from the same family but different genera were sometimes detected on the same determination line. All the human biological samples were correctly identified. Smartphone photographs of the coloration of the judgment line were processed using the ImageJ software for quantitative determination.
