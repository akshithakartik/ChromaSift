Title: LES study of turbulent ethanol spray flames using CSE coupled with non-adiabatic chemistry tables

Abstract: Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) is applied to three turbulent ethanol spray flames (EtF3, EtF6, and EtF8) in Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The objectives of this paper are to include the heat losses due to spray evaporation and gas radiation in the chemistry tabulation, assess the impact of these changes on the temperature and droplet statistics, and evaluate the performance of LES-CSE for the selected flames. The profiles of gas temperature, spray velocity, velocity root mean square (rms) and droplet size distribution are well reproduced in the simulations compared to available experimental data. Temperature underpredictions near the centreline are observed, in particular, at locations closer to the jet exit for flames with lower jet velocity. A wider flame is predicted in EtF8 compared to the experiment and regions of local extinction are visible. The use of non-adiabatic chemistry library results in a noticeable improvement in the temperature predictions near the peak locations, especially for flames with higher velocity and closer to the jet exit. The heat losses due to evaporation are larger than those from radiation, confirming the importance of including the evaporation effects in the chemistry tables. The droplet velocity is well predicted, except for EtF8 where an underprediction is observed far downstream. The velocity rms is slightly underpredicted at some locations, probably due to the simple stochastic model used. Overall, LES-CSE with non-adiabatic chemistry tables successfully captures the gas-spray quantities in the selected flames.
