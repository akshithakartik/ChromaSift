Title: Naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde as a pulsed-post column derivatization reagent; comparison with two alternative o-phthalaldehyde based chemistries for the determination of histamine

Abstract: In the present study, naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde (NDA) was used in on-line post column derivatization (PCD) coupled to liquid chromatography under the new concept of Pulsed-PCD. In Pulsed-PCD, the reagents are introduced into the flowing stream of the mobile phase under precise timing overlapping the eluted analyte. The consumption of the reagents is minimized to a few microliters, resulting in a significant advantage, that is the use of expensive reagents in PCD. For this reason, NDA-CN chemistry was used for the determination of histamine in food samples, such as eggplant and spinach. Two additional methods were developed based on the reaction of histamine with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA), namely the classic OPA – nucleophilic compound reaction and the specific OPA – histamine reaction in alkaline medium. The chromatographic conditions and the Pulsed-PCD conditions were investigated, while the analytical figures of merit were satisfactory. In all three methods, a pulse of 50 μL was used (OPA/NDA + Buffer), reducing dramatically the consumption of PCD reagents.
