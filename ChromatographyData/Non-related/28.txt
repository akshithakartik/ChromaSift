Title: The colorful world of sulfonephthaleins: Current applications in analytical chemistry for “old but gold” molecules

Abstract: Sulfonephthaleins represent one of the most common and widely employed reactive dyes in analytical chemistry, thanks to their stability, low-cost, well-visible colors, reactivity and possibilities of chemical modification. Despite being first proposed in 1916, nowadays, these molecules play a fundamental role in biological and medical applications, environmental analyses, food quality monitoring and other fields, with a particular focus on low-cost and disposable devices or methods for practical applications. Since up to our knowledge, no reviews or book chapters focused explicitly on sulfonephthaleins have ever been published, in this review, we will briefly describe sulfonephthaleins history, their acid-base properties will be discussed, and the most recent applications in different fields will be presented, focusing on the last ten years literature (2014–2023). Finally, safety and environmental issues will be briefly discussed, despite being quite controversial.
