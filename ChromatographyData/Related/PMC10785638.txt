Title: Combined Experimental and Theoretical Insights: Spectroscopic and Molecular Investigation of Polyphenols from &lt;i&gt;Fagonia indica&lt;/i&gt; via DFT, UV-vis, and FT-IR Approaches.

Abstract: This review deals with computational study of polyphenolic compounds of medicinal importance and interest for drug development. Herein, four polyphenolic compounds comprising catechol (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), caffeic acid (&lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;), gallic acid (&lt;b&gt;III&lt;/b&gt;), and pyrogallol (&lt;b&gt;IV&lt;/b&gt;) have been isolated from a medicinal specie, &lt;i&gt;Fagonia indica,&lt;/i&gt; by applying silica gel column chromatography. These compounds were identified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and confirmed by geometric computational analysis. According to computational results, caffeic acid has shown the highest biological activation due to higher chemical softness, electronegativity (\xcf\x87 (eV) = -648.644), and electrostatic potential value (-8.424 \xc3\x97 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; to +8.424 \xc3\x97 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;), while smaller values of chemical potential (-0.269), &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;LUMO&lt;/sub&gt; (-0.080), and energy gap (\xce\x94&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; = 0.149). The Mulliken atomic charges were calculated by using DFT/B3LYP with basis set 6-311G for the determination of active sites. The oxygen atom of catechol showed highest nucleophilic characteristic with a more negative charge (08 = -0.695), and pyrogallol indicated a strong electrophilic center at C14 = 0.415 with a higher positive charge. Moreover, UV-visible absorption spectra and a detailed study of vibrational frequencies for all phenolic compounds by employing the DFT approach with 3-21G, 6-31G, and 6-311G basis sets at the ground-state level showed the great agreement with experimental results. ANOVA has been applied to validate the theoretical data. Results suggest that compounds &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;IV&lt;/b&gt; are suitable in diverse fields.
