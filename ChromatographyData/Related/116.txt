Title: Recent advances in chiral liquid chromatography stationary phases for pharmaceutical analysis

Abstract: Chirality is a common phenomenon in nature. Different enantiomers of chiral drug compounds have obvious differences in their effects on the human body. Therefore, the separation of chiral drugs plays an extremely important role in the safe utilization of drugs. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is an effective tool for the separation and analysis of compounds, in which the chromatographic packing plays a key role in the separation. Chiral pharmaceutical separation and analysis in HPLC rely on chiral stationary phases (CSPs). Thus, various CSPs are being developed to meet the needs of chiral drug separation and analysis. In this review, recent developments in CSPs, including saccharides (cyclodextrin, cellulose, amylose and chitosan), macrocycles (macrocyclic glycopeptides, pillar[n]arene and polyamide) and porous organic materials (metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and porous organic cages), for pharmaceutical analysis in HPLC were summarized, the advantages and disadvantages of various stationary phases were introduced, and their development prospects were discussed.
