Title: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Production from Methyl Viologen-Dependent Hydrogenase Activity Monitored by Gas Chromatography.

Abstract: Bio-hydrogen production is an eco-friendly alternative to commercial H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, taking advantage of natural systems. Microbial hydrogenases play a main role in biological mechanisms, catalyzing proton reduction to molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) formation under ambient conditions. Direct determination is an important approach to screen bacteria with active hydrogenase and accurately quantify the amount of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Here, we present a detailed protocol for determining hydrogenase activity based on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production using methyl viologen (MV&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) as an artificial reductant, directly monitored by gas chromatography. Recombinant &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; is used as a hydrogenase-enriched model in this study. Even so, this protocol can be applied to determine hydrogenase activity in all biological samples. Key features \xe2\x80\xa2 This protocol is optimized for a wide variety of biological samples; both purified hydrogenase (in vitro) and intracellular hydrogenase (in vivo) systems. \xe2\x80\xa2 Direct, quantitative, and accurate method to detect the amount of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by gas chromatography with reproducibility. \xe2\x80\xa2 Requires only 2 h to complete and allows testing various conditions simultaneously. \xe2\x80\xa2 Kinetic plot of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production allows to analyze kinetic parameters and estimate the efficiency of hydrogenase from different organisms.
