Title: Analytical Ultracentrifugation-Calibrated Anion-Exchange Chromatography for Sensitive and Intact Determination of Osteopontin in Infant Formula and Dairy Products.

Abstract: Osteopontin is a crucial protein ingredient that has been applied in fortified dairy products and infant formula. It has great significance to infant gut health and brain development. However, current techniques including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry are still facing the bottleneck of low sensitivity and indirect quantification. Moreover, the unavailable certified commercial OPN standard hinders its accurate quantification. Herein, a novel method of anion-exchange chromatography was established to determine OPN concentration in several dairy matrices. The polarity-reversed capillary isoelectric focusing was utilized to measure the exact isoelectric point (pI) to support method development for OPN separation. Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to calibrate the purity of intact OPN to develop an in-house reference standard. The method showed the merits of limits of detection to 0.04 mg/100 g, relative standard deviation of reproducibility &lt;5% for 13 out of 14 tested matrices, and an average recovery rate of 101.3%. This method has shown the potential to be adopted as an international standard method for the quantification of intact OPN in infant formula and dairy products.
