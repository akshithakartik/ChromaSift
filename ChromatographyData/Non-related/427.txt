Title: Pyranoanthocyanins and other pyranoflavylium dyes: From chemistry towards novel applications

Abstract: Pyranoanthocyanins and pyranoflavylium analogous pigments occurring either naturally or from the synthetic origin are a family of flavylium derivatives that have risen the attention from the scientific community in several areas such as food, cosmetics, biomedical, and energy due to their physical-chemical features. This review presents an overview of the chemistry of these compounds including their synthesis procedures, formation mechanisms, physical-chemical characterization, spectroscopic properties, and interactions studies with macromolecules. Gathering all the insights about these pigments will allow exploring and investigating their potential technological applications such as dyes, colorants, photosensitizers, pH-sensors, and antioxidants, as well as in the development of emergent materials and devices from intelligent (bio)materials to organic electronics.
