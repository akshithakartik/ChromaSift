Title: Reversed HILIC Gradient: A Powerful Strategy for On-Line Comprehensive 2D-LC.

Abstract: The aim of the present work is to evaluate the possibilities and limitations of reversed hydrophilic interaction chromatography (revHILIC) mode in liquid chromatography (LC). This chromatographic mode consists of combining a highly polar stationary phase (bare silica) with a gradient varying from very low (1-5%) to high (40%) acetonitrile content (reversed gradient compared to HILIC). The retention behavior of revHILIC was first compared with that of reversed-phase LC (RPLC) and HILIC using representative mixtures of peptides and pharmaceutical compounds. It appears that the achievable selectivity can be ranked in the order RPLC &gt; revHILIC &gt; HILIC with the two different samples. Next, two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) conditions were evaluated by combining RPLC, revHILIC, or HILIC with RPLC in an on-line comprehensive (LC \xc3\x97 LC) mode. evHILIC \xc3\x97 RPLC not only showed impressive performance in terms of peak capacity and sensitivity, but also provided complementary selectivity compared to RPLC \xc3\x97 RPLC and HILIC \xc3\x97 RPLC. Indeed, both the elution order and the retention time range differ significantly between the three techniques. In conclusion, there is no doubt that revHILIC should be considered as a viable option for 2D-LC analysis of small molecules and also peptides.
