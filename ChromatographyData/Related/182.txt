Title: Highly selective and sensitive high performance liquid chromatography method for determination of fumonisins from feed samples with MIL-101 based dispersed micro-solid-phase extraction and precolumn fluorescence derivatization

Abstract: A selective and rapid high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) method for determining fumonisins was established and validated, which based on dispersed microsolid-phase extraction (D-μ-SPE) and precolumn derivatization. The MIL-101 was prepared as sorbents to selectively enrich two fumonisins from feed samples. The obtained extracts were labeled by a novel derivatization reagent 2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl 4-(1-methyl-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)benzoate (MPIBA-Su). There was no fluorescence from fumonisins itself, while their derivatives exhibited considerable fluorescence with a maximum excitation at λex 255 nm and a maximum emission at λem 457 nm. Key factors affecting extraction efficiency and derivatization efficiency were fully optimized. Excellent linearity was achieved with correlation coefficients > 0.9935 under optimal conditions. The detection limits (LODs) were between 2.4 and 3.5 ng·mL−1, and the quantitation limits (LOQs) were between 8.1 and 11.7 ng·mL−1. With recoveries in the range of 83.8% − 94.3%, the established method has successfully been applied to the quantitative analysis of fumonisins in feed samples.
