Title: Evaluating the Prebiotic Properties of Agar Oligosaccharides Obtained from the Red Alga &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria fisheri&lt;/i&gt; via Enzymatic Hydrolysis.

Abstract: Currently, the demand in the food market for oligosaccharides with biological activities is rapidly increasing. In this study, agar polysaccharides from &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria fisheri&lt;/i&gt; were treated with \xce\xb2-agarases and hydrolyzed to agar oligosaccharides (AOSs). High-performance anion-exchange chromatography/pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), were employed to analyze the chemical characteristics of AOSs. The FT-IR spectra revealed that the enzymatic hydrolysis had no effect on specific functional groups in the AOS molecule. To investigate the prebiotic and pathogen inhibitory effects of AOSs, the influence of AOSs on the growth of three probiotic and two pathogenic bacteria was examined. The gastrointestinal tolerance of probiotics in the presence of AOSs was also investigated. AOSs enhanced the growth of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/i&gt; by 254%, and inhibited the growth of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; by 32.80%, and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; by 58.94%. The highest survival rates of &lt;i&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; were maintained by AOSs in the presence of \xce\xb1-amylase and HCl under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. This study demonstrates that AOSs from &lt;i&gt;G. fisheri&lt;/i&gt; exhibit potential as a prebiotic additive in foods.
