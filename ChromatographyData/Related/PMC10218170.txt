Title: Boosting the Separation of Adeno-Associated Virus Capsid Proteins by Liquid Chromatography and Capillary Electrophoresis Approaches.

Abstract: The purity of the three capsid proteins that make up recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is considered a critical quality attribute of gene therapy products. As such, there is a clear need to develop separation methods capable of rapidly characterizing these three viral proteins (VPs). In this study, the potential benefits and limitations of different electrophoretic and chromatographic methods were evaluated, including capillary electrophoresis-sodium dodecyl sulfate (CE-SDS), reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), for the analysis of VPs obtained from different serotypes (i.e., AAV2, AAV5, AAV8, and AAV9). CE-SDS is considered to be the reference method and provides a suitable separation of VP1-3 proteins using generic conditions and laser induced fluorescence detection. However, the characterization of post-translational modifications (i.e., phosphorylation, oxidation) remains difficult, and species identification is almost impossible due to the lack of compatibility between CE-SDS and mass spectrometry (MS). In contrast, RPLC and HILIC were found to be less generic than CE-SDS and require tedious optimization of the gradient conditions for each AAV serotype. However, these two chromatographic approaches are inherently compatible with MS, and were shown to be particularly sensitive in detecting capsid protein variants resulting from different post-translational modifications. Finally, despite being non-denaturing, HIC offers disappointing performance for viral capsid proteins characterization.
