Title: Simultaneous regulation on coordination environment and interfacial chemistry via taurine for stabilized Zn metal anode

Abstract: Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) are the potential options for the next-generation energy storage scenarios due to the cost effectiveness and intrinsic safety. Nevertheless, the industrial application of AZIBs is still impeded by a series of parasitic reactions and dendrites at zinc anodes. In this study, taurine (TAU) is used in electrolyte to simultaneously optimize the coordination condition of the ZnSO4 electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the anode. TAU can preferentially adsorb with the zinc metal and induce an in situ stable and protective interface on the anode, which would avoid the connection between H2O and the zinc metal and promote the even deposition of Zn2+. The resulting Zn//Zn batteries achieve more than 3000 hours long cyclic lifespan under 1 mA cm−2 and an impressive cumulative capacity at 5 mA cm−2. Moreover, Zn//Cu batteries can realize a reversible plating/stripping process over 2,400 cycles, with a desirable coulombic efficiency of 99.75% (1 mA cm−2). Additionally, the additive endows Zn//NH4V4O10 batteries with more stable cyclic performance and ultrafast rate capability. These capabilities can promote the industrial application of AZIBs.
