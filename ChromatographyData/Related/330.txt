Title: Chromatography and hyphenated techniques in quality-based standardization of medicinal plants: Current scenario and future perspectives

Abstract: Authentication of medicinal plants and their derived formulations are contributed to the quality, safety, and efficacy as well as to their regulatory purpose. Chromatography and their hyphenation with spectroscopic techniques are the most used analytical methods for quality assessment and authentication of medicinal plants and their derived products, also. The present study is aimed to explore the quality aspects of the authentication of medicinal plants and their derived formulation with a comprehensive explanation of analytical techniques used in authentication, current scenario, and future perspectives. The data was gathered from different online data bases such as Science Direct, Google Scholar, Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, PubMed, etc. The finding of the review suggested that targeted and non-targeted metabolites-based quality assessment of medicinal plants depends on authentication of medicinal plants belong to the same species, collection of quality raw material, extraction method, and the acting solvents for more suitability in applied process. Many cutting-edge chromatographic and analytical approaches such as HPTLC-MS, HPLC-MS, LC-MS, GCâ€“MS, etc are familiarized for complete metabolomic profiling. Moreover, chemometric techniques better contributed to mining essential chemical information from a wide diversity of original data. Among the chemometrics analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) is the most commonly used method that represents the large dimensionality of data sets based on metabolites for authenticity, efficacy and consistency. Hence, this review comprehended the in-sights into the current scenario and the future perspectives for quality-based standardization of medicinal plants and their derived formulations and to validate the scientific evidence for their regulatory purpose.
