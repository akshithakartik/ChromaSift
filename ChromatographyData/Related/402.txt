Title: Targeted isolation of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors from Saussurea obvallata using affinity ultrafiltration combined with preparative liquid chromatography

Abstract: Saussurea obvallata (S. obvallata) is widely used in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with high medicinal and edible values of reducing inflammation. But, the individual components and mechanisms of action still ill-defined. In this work, an integrated method using affinity ultrafiltration combined with preparative liquid chromatography was developed to identify and separate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors from S. obvallata. The sample was pretreated using on-line medium pressure liquid chromatography to yield the active fraction. Then, the potential COX-2 ligands were screened out using affinity ultrafiltration from the targeted fraction and the identified compounds were isolated via preparative liquid chromatography. As a result, four main compounds, coniferin (1), syringin (2), roseoside (3) and grasshopper ketone (4) were targeted isolated with IC50 values of 12.34 ± 1.81, 4.04 ± 0.43, 13.91 ± 2.46 and 7.97 ± 1.21 µM, respectively. Results of this work demonstrated that the developed strategy was effective for the targeted separation of COX-2 inhibitors from natural product extracts.
