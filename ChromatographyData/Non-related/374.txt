Title: 10.01 Introduction: X-ray, neutron and electron scattering methods in inorganic chemistry

Abstract: Over the last âˆ¼40years, the instrumentation, source technology and user accessibility of synchrotron and neutron facilities worldwide has improved substantially, and further major improvements are underway. These facilities now allow inorganic chemists to carry out a wide variety of complex experiments, almost on a day-to-day basis, that were not possible in the recent past. Synchrotron and neutron radiation is used as an analytical tool to study the structure (atomic and electronic) and dynamics of materials/molecules of interest to scientists across the life and physical sciences, and beyond. Past editions of Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry have included many examples of successful synchrotron or neutron studies, but the increased importance of such experiments to inorganic chemists motivated us to produce a volume in Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry (CIC) III dedicated to the methodology developed and the results obtained. In this volume we present chapters covering recent examples of state-of-the-art experiments and refer back to some of the pioneering work leading to the current state of the science in this exciting area. We also recognize the great importance of complementary techniques by including a chapter on electron crystallography.
