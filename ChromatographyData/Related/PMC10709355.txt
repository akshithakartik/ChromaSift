Title: Association between gut microbiota and its functional metabolites with prenatal depression in women.

Abstract: &lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The gut microbiota may affect mood through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the gut microbiota and its metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), on prenatal depression and to determine the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on prenatal depression in association with the gut microbiota and its metabolites (i.e. SCFAs).&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Eighty-six pregnant women in the third trimester were recruited. Prenatal depression was determined by a score of 10 via the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. Demographic data, stool, and blood samples were collected. The gut microbiota and its metabolites SCFAs were determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Plasma 5-HT was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;After controlling relevant covariates, our results found the higher the abundance of &lt;i&gt;Candidatus_Soleaferrea&lt;/i&gt;, the lower the risk of prenatal depression; the higher the concentration of propanoic acid, the higher risk of prenatal depression. Our results also found the lower the plasma 5-HT, the higher the risk of prenatal depression, and 5-HT was related to &lt;i&gt;unclassified_c_Clostridia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;NK4A214_group&lt;/i&gt;. However, results of this study did not support the moderating effect of plasma 5-HT on the association of &lt;i&gt;Candidatus_Soleaferrea&lt;/i&gt; or propionic acid with prenatal depression.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Results of this study supported that changes in certain gut microbiota, SCFAs, and plasma 5-HT during pregnancy were associated with prenatal depression. This finding provides new ideas for interventions based on diet or probiotics to regulate mood during pregnancy.
