Title: A quality comparison for Xiecun Huangjiu with different aging stages based on chemical profile, aroma composition and microbial succession.

Abstract: The Xiecun Huangjiu (XCHJ), an exemplary representation of North Huangjiu, exhibits a distinct and invigorating aroma predominantly formed during its aging period. In this study, we observed dynamic changes in 16 key aroma compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) during the aging of XCHJ, with compounds such as phenethylalcohol, isoamylalcohol, benzaldehyde, and ethylbenzoate initially increasing and then decreasing. Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) detected nineteen amino acids, with total content ranging from 1901.45 to 3764.45\xc2\xa0mg/L. High-throughput sequencing indicated that &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas, Ochrobactrum, Moesziomyces&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; et al. were abundant in aged XCHJ. Totally, 4 bacteria and 8 fungi exhibited strong associations with aroma compounds production. Physicochemical properties were primarily interacted with &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudeurotium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thermomyces&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Blautia&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis highlighted significant interactions between &lt;i&gt;Pantoea&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rhodotorula&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Monascus&lt;/i&gt;, and amino acids. These findings provide valuable insights for the regulation of aroma in aged XCHJ.
