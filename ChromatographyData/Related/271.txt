Title: Development and evaluation of pulsed – Post column derivatization in liquid chromatography as a concept to minimize reagent consumption

Abstract: In the current article, we propose an alternative approach to reduce the consumption of the reagents in liquid chromatography coupled to on-line post column derivatization. In our proposal post column reagents do not flow continuously but they are instead introduced as well-defined pulses (at microliter levels) that are merged on-line with the eluted analytes through precise tuning (Pulsed-Post Column Derivatization, Pulsed-PCD). The profiles of the pulses in terms of time and flow rate were investigated “visually” using caffeine as model compound (at 274 nm). The robustness of the procedure was evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations and was verified taking into account the precisions of typically used propulsion systems. As a proof of concept, we selected the determination of histidine in human urine after separation by cation exchange chromatography and Pulsed-PCD derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde. The consumption of the derivatizing reagent was downscaled to the microliter level per run, while the analytical results were within the expected ranges (110 – 1520 µmol L−1) and with good agreement with the corroborative method based on classic HPLC-PCD.
