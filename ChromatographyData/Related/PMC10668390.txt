Title: Simultaneous analysis of the of levamisole with triclabendazole in pharmaceuticals through developing TLC and HPLC-PDA chromatographic techniques and their greenness assessment using GAPI and AGREE methods.

Abstract: Two simple and rapid chromatographic methods were developed and validated for the analysis of levamisole and triclabendazole simultaneously in pure and pharmaceutical products. The first method is thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with densitometry, and the second method is high-performance liquid chromatography with PDA detection (HPLC-PDA). A Hypersil BDS C18 column with dimensions of 4.6\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89150\xc2\xa0mm and a particle size of 5 \xc2\xb5m was used in the HPLC-PDA method. An isocratic condition was used to carry out the separation, and the mobile phase was made up of acetonitrile and a 0.03 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer in double-distilled water. The ratio of the mobile phase preparation was 70:30 (v/v), and the flow rate was 1\xc2\xa0mL/min. A wavelength of 215 nm was employed for analyte detection. Precoated silica gel 60 F254 aluminium plates were used for the TLC method\'s separation. Mobile phase was made of ethyl acetate, hexane, methanol, and ammonia (69:15:15:1) for the separation. The detection wavelength selected was 215 nm. According to the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, the proposed methods were validated and it was found that the two chromatographic methods are accurate, precise, and linear for both compounds in the range of 3.75-37.5 and 6-60 mg/L for the HPLC method for levamisole and triclabendazole, respectively and in the range of 2-14 \xc2\xb5g/spot for the TLC method. The developed methods greenness profile was assessed using AGREE and ComplexGAPI tools.
