Title: Dialysis and column chromatography for biomass pyrolysis liquids separation

Abstract: In the current study, a novel approach for separating value-added chemicals from pine wood residues’ pyrolysis liquids (bio-oil) was effectively carried out. It combined two separation techniques used for the first time in this field: dialysis with water, methanol and acetone, and column chromatography with Amberlite™ XAD7 resin. This strategy made it possible to separate bio-oil into four fractions: (1) pyrolytic lignin, which can be utilized in the synthesis of resins, foams, electrodes, asphalt, etc. (2) acid-rich fraction, with particular relevance to the chemical industry, (3) antioxidant fraction, containing phenolic compounds, with a lot of interest for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry, and (4) a final fraction containing the most non-polar chemicals from bio-oil. Thus, it was possible to develop a process that allows the obtention of bioproducts from woody biomass, a residue obtained in significant quantities in the management of non-profitable forests, making a step forward within the context of circular economy and bioeconomy.
