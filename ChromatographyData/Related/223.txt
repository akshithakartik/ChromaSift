Title: Characteristics of size-exclusion chromatography enriched porcine follicular fluid extracellular vesicles

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanoparticles that are released by different cell types and play a crucial role in the intercellular communication. They carry various biomolecular compounds such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. Given that EVs are a new element of the communication within the ovarian follicle, extensive research is needed to optimize method of their isolation. The aim of the study was to assess size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) as a tool for effective EVs isolation from porcine ovarian follicular fluid. The characterization of EVs was performed by nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, mass spectrometry and Western blot. We determined EVs concentration, size distribution, zeta potential, morphology, purity, and marker proteins. Our results show that SEC is an effective method for isolation of EVs from porcine follicular fluid. They displayed predominantly exosome properties with sufficient purity and possibility for further functional analyses, including proteomics.
