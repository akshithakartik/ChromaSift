Title: Advancements in Analyzing Tumor Metabolites through Chemical Derivatization-Based Chromatography

Abstract: Understanding the metabolic abnormalities of tumors is crucial for early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Accurate identification and quantification of metabolites in biological samples are essential to investigate the relationship between metabolite variations and tumor development. Common techniques like LC-MS and GC-MS face challenges in measuring aberrant metabolites in tumors due to their strong polarity, isomerism, or low ionization efficiency during MS detection. Chemical derivatization of metabolites offers an effective solution to overcome these challenges. This review focuses on the difficulties encountered in analyzing aberrant metabolites in tumors, the principles behind chemical derivatization methods, and the advancements in analyzing tumor metabolites using derivatization-based chromatography. It serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding the analysis and detection of tumor metabolites, particularly those that are highly polar and exhibit low ionization efficiency.
