Title: Dioxin(-like)-Related Biological Effects through Integrated Chemical-wide and Metabolome-wide Analyses.

Abstract: Dioxin(-like) exposures are linked to adverse health effects, including cancer. However, metabolic alterations induced by these chemicals remain largely unknown. Beyond known dioxin(-like) compounds, we leveraged a chemical-wide approach to assess chlorinated co-exposures and parent compound products [termed dioxin(-like)-related compounds] among 137 occupational workers. Endogenous metabolites were profiled by untargeted metabolomics, namely, reversed-phase chromatography with negative electrospray ionization (C18-negative) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with positive electrospray ionization (HILIC-positive). We performed a metabolome-wide association study to select dioxin(-like) associated metabolic features using a 20% false discovery rate threshold. Metabolic features were then characterized by pathway enrichment analyses. There are no significant features associated with polychlorinated dibenzo-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-dioxins (PCDDs), a subgroup of known dioxin(-like) compounds. However, 3,110 C18-negative and 2,894 HILIC-positive features were associated with at least one of the PCDD-related compounds. Abundant metabolic changes were also observed for polychlorinated dibenzofuran-related and polychlorinated biphenyl-related compounds. These metabolic features were primarily enriched in pathways of amino acids, lipid and fatty acids, carbohydrates, cofactors, and nucleotides. Our study highlights the potential of chemical-wide analysis for comprehensive exposure assessment beyond targeted chemicals. Coupled with advanced endogenous metabolomics, this approach allows for an in-depth exploration of metabolic alterations induced by environmental chemicals.
