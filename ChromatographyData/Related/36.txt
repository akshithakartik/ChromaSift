Title: An open-source smart fraction collector for isocratic preparative liquid chromatography

Abstract: Preparative liquid chromatography is a technique for separating complex samples or isolating pure compounds from complex extracts. It involves eluting samples through a packed column and selectively collecting or isolating the separated bands in a sequence of fractions. Depending on the column length and the sample complexity, a large number of fractions may be obtained, making fraction collection a laborious and time-consuming process. Manual fraction collection is also tedious, error-prone, less reproducible, and susceptible to contamination. Several commercial and lab-made solutions are available for automated fraction collection, but most systems do not synchronize with the instrument detector and collect fractions at fixed volumes or time intervals. We have assembled a low-cost Arduino-based smart fraction collector that can record the signal from the UVâ€“vis detector of the chromatography instrument and enable the automated selective collection of the targeted bands. The system consists of a robot equipped with position sensors and a 3-way solenoid valve that switches the column effluent between the waste or collection positions. By proper programming, an Arduino board records the detector response and actuates the solenoid valve, the position sensors, and the stepper motors to collect the target chromatographic bands.
