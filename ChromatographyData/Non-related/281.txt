Title: Integrated interface configuration by in-situ interface chemistry enabling uniform lithium deposition in all-solid-state lithium metal batteries

Abstract: All-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are considered as one of the ultimate goals for the development of energy storage systems due to their high energy density and high safety. However, the mismatching of interface transport kinetics as well as interfacial instability induces the growth of lithium dendrite and thus, leads to severe degradation of battery electrochemical performances. Herein, an integrated interface configuration (IIC) consisting of in-situ generated LiI interphase and Li-Ag alloy anode is proposed through in-situ interface chemistry. The IIC is capable of not only regulating charge transport kinetics but also synchronously stabilizing the lithium/electrolyte interface, thereby achieving uniform lithium platting. Therefore, Li||Li symmetric cells with IIC achieve a critical current density of up to 1.6 mA cm−2 and achieve stable cycling over 1600 hours at a high current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. Moreover, a high discharge capacity of 140.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C is also obtained for the Li(Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2)O2 (NCM622) full battery with a capacity retention of 65.6% after 300 cycles. This work provides an effective method to synergistically regulate the interface transport kinetics and inhibit lithium dendrite growth for high-performance ASSLMBs.
