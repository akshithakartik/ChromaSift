Title: Novel liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based approaches for the determination of glyphosate and related compounds: A review

Abstract: Although glyphosate (Gly) is one of the most widely used agrochemicals, it is also of the most difficult to measure. Gly, its metabolites, and related compounds cannot be sought within the scope of multi-residue methods. Specific so-called single-residue methods are used instead. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is currently the most widely used technique for determining Gly and its metabolites. This review addresses the different LC-MS-based methods proposed for the determination of Gly and related species in food and environment matrices. Sample preparation (food and environment), as well as their determination based in novel liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry approaches including different specific stationary phases are presented and the specific analytical challenges, strengths and drawbacks are critically discussed.
