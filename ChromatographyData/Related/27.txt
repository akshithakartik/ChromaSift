Title: Effectively removing the homodimer in bispecific antibodies by weak partitioning mode of anion exchange chromatography

Abstract: Small amounts of by-products are nevertheless created during the recombinant production of IgG-like bispecific antibodies due to imbalanced chain expression and improper chain pairing, despite the employment of molecular strategy techniques to promote accurate pairing. Among them, homodimers represent the species that are more difficult to remove due to their physical and chemical properties being similar to the target antibody. Homodimer by-products are always produced even though various technologies can significantly increase the expression of heterodimers, so a robust purification process to recover high-purity heterodimers is required. Most of the chromatography methods commonly adopt the bind-and-elute mode or two-step to separate homodimers, which has numerous drawbacks such as prolonged process times and limited dynamic binding capacity. Flow-through mode of anion exchange is a frequently-used polishing step for antibodies, but it is typically regarded as being more effective for host-cell protein or host-cell DNA removal rather than other product-related impurities such as homodimers and aggregates. This paper demonstrated that single-step anion exchange chromatography allows high capacity and effective clearance of the homodimer byproduct to be simultaneously achieved, suggesting that weak partitioning was a better polishing strategy for achieving a high level of heterodimer purity. And robust operation range of anion exchange chromatography steps for homodimer removal was also developed by leveraging the design of experiments.
