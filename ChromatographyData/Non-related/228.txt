Title: Green chemistry methods for food analysis: Overview of sample preparation and determination

Abstract: In recent years, food quality and safety have gained increasing attention. However, due to the complexity of food composition, accurate classical extraction techniques require using toxic organic solvents. The development of green extraction techniques has come to the fore to repress this drawback. In this review, the recent novel methodologies for extracting pollutants from food samples that fulfill the principles of green chemistry were summarized. The use of sorbent-based techniques, such as solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and stir-bar sorbent extraction (SBSE), and advanced techniques such as ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), for improving and accelerating extraction efficiency and reducing solvent consumption are highlighted. Lastly, future perspectives on the implementation of these eco-friendly methodologies are described along with the technological advancements required.
