Title: Flavor and sensory profile of Chinese traditional fish noodles produced by different silver carp (&lt;i&gt;hypophthalmichthys molitrix&lt;/i&gt;) mince ingredients.

Abstract: This study employs sensory evaluation, headspace gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS), and headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) techniques to investigate the effect of different pretreatment of fresh silver carp mince (running water rinsing 0, 1, or 2 times) and commercially frozen surimi on the odor characteristics of fish noodles. The free choice profiling (FCP) and check all that apply (CATA) sensory analysis methods were utilized to identify 10 characteristic descriptors, which include "grass, fish fragrance, unpleasant fishy, fatty, roast, ammonia, caramel, warmed-over, earthy, and mushroomy". HS-GC-IMS and HS-SPME-GC-MS detected 80 and 37 volatile compounds (VCs) in fish noodles. The 1-Penten-3-ol, (E)-2-pentenal-D, hexanal-D, pentanal-D, (E,E)-2, 4-heptadienal-D contents were significantly correlated with "fish fragrance" and "unpleasant fishy", and octanal, nonanal, heptanal, 2-methylpyrazine contents were significantly correlated with "warmed-over" flavor. The results of this study can be helpful for fish noodle quality improvement and industrial production.
