Title: [Determination of four amide synthetic cannabinoid isomers by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry].

Abstract: Isomerization commonly occurs in synthetic cannabinoids (SCs). Owing to the few differences in their structure and properties, it is difficult to simultaneously separate and identify them. Thus, the identification of synthetic cannabinoids is challenging, posing a threat to public security. This study aims to separate and identify four SCs, which are 2-[1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indole-3-formylamino]-3,3-dimethylbutyrate methyl ester (5F-MDMB-PICA), 2-[1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indole-3-formylamino]-3-methylbutyrate ethyl ester (5F-EMB-PICA), &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(1-amino-2,2-dimethyl-1-oxobutyl-2-yl)-1-butyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazole-3-formamide (ADB-BINACA), &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(1-carbamoyl-2-methylpropyl)-1-pentyl indazole-3-formamide (AB-PINACA).Supercritical fluid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (SFC-MS) can realize the effective separation of some cannabinoid isomers. However, most laboratories are not equipped with SFC-MS systems. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-HRMS) effectively combines the excellent efficient separation characteristics of liquid chromatography and the powerful qualitative ability of mass spectrometry. It is a commonly used technical method for the detection of amide synthetic cannabinoids and their metabolites in vivo and in vitro because of its advantages of high accuracy and efficiency. Liquid chromatography allows the separation of tested components by exploiting the difference in the partition coefficients between the mobile and stationary phases. When the two phases are in relative motion, the tested components are divided between the two phases, facilitating the separation and analysis of each component. Although the difference in the polarities of the tested amide synthetic cannabinoid isomeric substances is extremely small, liquid chromatography can induce a strong separation effect. The advantages of UHPLC-HRMS include high resolution imparted by mass spectrometry and high sensitivity, allowing its application in the qualitative analysis of various substances. Through UHPLC-HRMS, trace analytes at the nanogram scale as well as pure drugs and their metabolites in biosamples can be detected. This study proposed a method for the determination of two pairs of amide synthetic cannabinoid isomers-5F-EMB-PICA and 5F-MDMB-PICA, ADB-BINACA and AB-PINACA-through UHPLC-HRMS. A Hypersil GOLD C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; column (100 mm\xc3\x972.1 mm, 1.9 \xce\xbcm) was selected for separation via liquid chromatography, and gradient elution was performed with methanol containing 0.1% formic acid and a 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution containing 10 mmol/L ammonium formate. Full scan/data-dependent secondary mass spectrometry (Full MS/dd-MS&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was conducted in the positive ion mode for detection. The results indicated that the four synthetic cannabinoid isomers could be accurately detected under the abovementioned conditions. The resolution between 5F-EMB-PICA and 5F-MDMB-PICA was 2.06, while that between ADB-BINACA and AB-PINACA was 1.22, indicating the effective separation and detection of both pairs. Furthermore, method validation was conducted to ensure the accuracy of the proposed method. The relationship of the four amide synthetic cannabinoid isomers exhibited excellent linearity. The correlation coefficients (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were &gt;0.99. Moreover, the matrix effects of the four SCs in hair samples were between 88.67% and 111.76% and the recoveries were 96.23%-105.11%. The intra-day and inter-day precisions (RSDs) were &lt;10%. The proposed method was used to identify the case materials. AB-PINACA was detected in a hair sample at a content of 0.73 \xce\xbcg/g. 5F-MDMB-PICA was detected in a tobacco sample at a content of 11.3 mg/g. The results indicate that the proposed method can be used for the examination of practical samples conducted by public security organizations. This study provides a reference method for the identification of synthetic cannabinoid isomers.
