Title: Current medicinal chemistry strategies in the discovery of novel HIV-1 ribonuclease H inhibitors

Abstract: During HIV-1 genome replication, the viral reverse transcriptase-associated ribonuclease H (RT-associated RNase H) activity hydrolyzes the RNA strand of RNA/DNA heteroduplex intermediates. As of today, HIV-1 RNase H inhibitors (RHIs) remain at an investigational level, although none of them reached clinical trials. Therefore, RNase H remains as an attractive target for drug design and development. In this paper, we review the current status of medicinal chemistry strategies aimed at the discovery of novel RHIs, while discussing problems encountered in their characterization and further development, thereby providing an update on recent progress in the field.
