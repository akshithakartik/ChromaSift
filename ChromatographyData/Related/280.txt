Title: Two-dimensional liquid chromatographyÂ approaches for food authenticity

Abstract: The use of two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) is expanding in the last few years within the food analysis field. 2DLC methods are characterized by providing notably higher-resolving power than conventional one-dimensional approaches. As a result, a greater number of components may be separated in complex food samples. These characteristics may be used for the characterization of valuable food samples depending on their diverse chemical, biological, or geographical origin, being a useful tool for food authentication. In this review, the most recent advancements in the use of 2DLC in its various operating modes in the field of food authentication are summarized and described. Moreover, the main advantages and future outlooks are also critically discussed.
