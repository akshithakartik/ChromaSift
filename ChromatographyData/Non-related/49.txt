Title: Chapter 1 Introduction to environmental and green chemistry

Abstract: Both environmental chemistry and green chemistry are important and have a crucial role in the ecosystem; however environmental chemistry discusses about the environmental problems, while green chemistry provides the solution. Green chemistry is new emerging area that strives to achieve the sustainability at the molecular level. Green chemistry generally deals with reduction or minimizing the harmful and toxic chemical products with eco-friendly one. From the past few decades, green chemistry has received a remarkable attention of the researchers due to its ability to achieve environmental and economic goals by doing chemical invention. Through different major modification of green chemistry including renewable feedstocks, biocatalysts, green solvents, dual aims of environmental protection and economic benefits could be achieved. This chapter generally covers the concept of origin of environmental and green chemistry with a cohesive set of 12 principles.
