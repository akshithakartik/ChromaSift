Title: Photoactive donor-acceptor conjugated macrocycles: New opportunities for supramolecular chemistry

Abstract: The design and synthesis of photoactive macrocyclic molecules continue to attract attention because such species play important roles in supramolecular chemistry as well as photoelectronic applications. Donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugated macrocycles are an emerging class of photoactive molecules due to their D-A conjugated structural characteristics and tunable optical properties. In addition, the well-defined cavities in such D-A macrocycles endow them with versatile host-guest properties. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of D-A conjugated macrocycle chemistry, detailing recent progress in the area of synthetic methods, optical properties, host-guest chemistry and applications of the underlying chemistry to chemical sensors, bioimaging and photoelectronic devices. Our objective is to provide not only a review of the fundamental findings, but also to outline future research directions where D-A conjugated macrocycles and their constructs may have a role to play.
