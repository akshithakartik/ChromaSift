Title: Applicability of supercritical fluid chromatography for oligonucleotide analysis: A proof-of-concept study

Abstract: We evaluated the suitability of supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) for oligonucleotide analysis using 4-mer oligonucleotides with various phosphorothioate (PS) contents as model compounds. Column screening showed that the diol-modified column was able to separate sequences with different PS contents. Optimization of the column body and additives allowed us to analyze polar oligonucleotides using SFC. Various sequences were also analyzed using the optimized method. A good peak shape was obtained when the guanine plus cytosine content of the analyte was two or less in the 4-mer oligonucleotides. Furthermore, we found that the retention times of the selected sequences were positively correlated with polar surface areas, indicating that oligonucleotides interact with polar stationary phases. In contrast, more hydrophobic full PS sequences were retained more strongly in the diol column than the full phosphodiester (PO) sequences. This suggests that the diol column has unique selectivity for PO and PS linkages. These results indicate that SFC is potentially applicable to oligonucleotide analysis with a separation mechanism that is different from that of ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography.
