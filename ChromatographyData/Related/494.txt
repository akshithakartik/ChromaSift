Title: Characterization and validation of a middle-down hydrophobic interaction chromatography method to monitor methionine oxidation in IgG1

Abstract: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can impact the efficacy of a drug. Methionine oxidation can alter the overall hydrophobicity of an antibody, thereby inducing conformational changes and affecting its biological activity. To ensure high quality, safety, and efficacy of mAbs, routine monitoring of PTMs such as methionine (Met) oxidation is essential. Met oxidation in the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of immunoglobulin-G1 (IgG1) is a potential critical quality attribute because it impacts not only the interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor and protein A but also the half-life of mAbs in serum circulation. Although bottom-up mass spectrometry provides high site specificity, it may have limited application in quality control workflows, and its complicated sample preparation could result in procedure-induced oxidation. In this study, we describe the development and characterization of a rapid and robust middle-down hydrophobic interaction chromatography method for monitoring Met oxidation in the Fc region of IgG1. Additionally, we assessed a comprehensive method validation package and demonstrated the specificity, linearity, precision, and accuracy of the new method within a range of 3.8â€“37.7%. The relative quantitative data provided by this method may be used in a regulated workflow to support process and formulation development as well as in the later stages of drug development and batch release and stability studies.
