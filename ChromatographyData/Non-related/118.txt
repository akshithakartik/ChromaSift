Title: Organometallic compounds for epoxidation chemistry: A brief insight into research developments

Abstract: Catalytic epoxidation reactions are an important area in chemical industries. Since the 1960s high oxidation state transition metal complexes have been examined and applied as homogeneous (molecular) catalysts for this reaction, with organometallic compounds figuring prominently. The author and his research group have been doing work in this area for about 30 years. Starting with Re(VII) compounds, continuing with Mo(VI) derivatives and finally examining bio-inspired iron compounds with carbene ligands, it has been shown that the reaction mechanisms can vary significantly, however, with metal oxides or peroxides always playing an important role. However, a variety of side reactions and decomposition pathways did not allow so far the establishment on an “ideal” system that would be able to rival or surpass the heterogeneous systems currently in industrial use. Together with the contributions of many other research groups, it has nevertheless been possible to obtain a profound insight in the sophisticated chemistry involved in these reactions.
