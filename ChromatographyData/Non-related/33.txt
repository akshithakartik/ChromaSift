Title: 50 Years of Passion for Organometallic Chemistry

Abstract: During a 50 years history of Organometallic Chemistry, the author - a former Regional Editor of the Journal of Organometallic Chemistry - and his Regensburg, Frankfurt, and Munich research groups contribuited to the shaping and progress of ths field which became more and more interdisciplinary ever since. Thus, akey discovery was the power and verstility of N-heterocyclic carbenes as highly activating and versatile novel catalysts ligands in various carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions, particularly olefin metathesis and Heck-type reactions. Other disseminating research contributions cover metal-metal multiple bonds, dimetallacyclopropanes, orgaometal oxides, water-soluble catalysts for the industrial hydroformylation, and metal alkoxides including organolanthanoids for CVD-processes.
