Title: &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/i&gt; Differentiation-Inducing Factor 1 Promotes Glucose Uptake via Direct Inhibition of Mitochondrial Malate Dehydrogenase in Mouse 3T3-L1 Cells.

Abstract: Differentiation-inducing factor 1 (DIF-1), found in &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium discoideum&lt;/i&gt;, has antiproliferative and glucose-uptake-promoting activities in mammalian cells. DIF-1 is a potential lead for the development of antitumor and/or antiobesity/antidiabetes drugs, but the mechanisms underlying its actions have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we searched for target molecules of DIF-1 that mediate the actions of DIF-1 in mammalian cells by identifying DIF-1-binding proteins in human cervical cancer HeLa cells and mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblast cells using affinity chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and found mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) to be a DIF-1-binding protein in both cell lines. Since DIF-1 has been shown to directly inhibit MDH2 activity, we compared the effects of DIF-1 and the MDH2 inhibitor LW6 on the growth of HeLa and 3T3-L1 cells and on glucose uptake in confluent 3T3-L1 cells in vitro. In both HeLa and 3T3-L1 cells, DIF-1 at 10-40 \xce\xbcM dose-dependently suppressed growth, whereas LW6 at 20 \xce\xbcM, but not at 2-10 \xce\xbcM, significantly suppressed growth in these cells. In confluent 3T3-L1 cells, DIF-1 at 10-40 \xce\xbcM significantly promoted glucose uptake, with the strongest effect at 20 \xce\xbcM DIF-1, whereas LW6 at 2-20 \xce\xbcM significantly promoted glucose uptake, with the strongest effect at 10 \xce\xbcM LW6. Western blot analyses showed that LW6 (10 \xce\xbcM) and DIF-1 (20 \xce\xbcM) phosphorylated and, thus, activated AMP kinase in 3T3-L1 cells. Our results suggest that MDH2 inhibition can suppress cell growth and promote glucose uptake in the cells, but appears to promote glucose uptake more strongly than it suppresses cell growth. Thus, DIF-1 may promote glucose uptake, at least in part, via direct inhibition of MDH2 and a subsequent activation of AMP kinase in 3T3-L1 cells.
