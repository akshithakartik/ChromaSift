Title: Chapter 18 Current prospective of green chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry

Abstract: From last two decades, green chemistry has given major contributions to compete the challenge of sustainability in the development of our society. Green chemistry is one of the branch of chemistry which deals with many aspects like encouragement of sustainable chemistry, research, education, and in pharmaceutical industry, with the aim of improving chemical products, processes, and reduction of waste. Nowadays, there is an increasing demand of our society to produce greener and more sustainable chemical processes to overcome the harmful consequences of conventional chemistry’s processes and methods. Thus, green chemistry aims at making chemistry’s processes, design, methodology, etc. more efficient by using green solvent, biocatalyst, green reagent, and produce innovative products without causing any harm to natural resources. Currently, many pharmaceutical industries have shifted their interest toward green chemistry for the development of environment friendly and economical products. Here, the authors have discussed some aspects and applications of green chemistry in relation to pharmaceutical industry.
