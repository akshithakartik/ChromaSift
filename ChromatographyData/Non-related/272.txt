Title: Copper-free click chemistry assisted antibodies for immunodetection of interleukin-10 in saliva

Abstract: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is secreted in response to an acute phase inflammation in patients who are suffering from heart failure (HF). The aim of this work was to develop an electrochemical biosensor for determining salivary IL-10 levels. Biofunctionalization strategy was improved through the use of copper-free click chemistry for the developed sensor due to its advantages, leading to high quantitative yields of stable triazoles, rapid reaction, no cytotoxic Cu(I) catalyst requirement, and high specificity of cyclooctynes toward azides. The approach involved in binding of dibenzocyclooctyne acid (DBCO-COOH) to thiol-azide assembled gold microelectrodes, later capturing the monoclonal IL-10 antibody (IL-10 mAb), and ultimately allowing direct detection of IL-10 antigen. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nanoplotter associated with fluorescence microscopy methods have been employed to analyze and prove the biofunctionalization of the gold microelectrodes. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was used for detecting IL-10 antigen. The developed immunosensor showed a semi-logarithmic linear range, from 0.1 pg/mL to 5 pg/mL with R2 = 0.9815 and a limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.1 pg/mL with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 10.67%. The specificity of the immunosensor was evaluated using an inflammatory cytokine, and none of it generated detectable EIS signals. Finally, the successful analysis of saliva samples from a healthy volunteer without Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection demonstrated the usefulness of the developed immunosensor.
