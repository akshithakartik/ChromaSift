Title: A high-performance liquid chromatography with dSPE clean-up method for determination of biogenic amines in ripened meat products

Abstract: Biogenic amines (BAs) are nitrogen compounds formed during decarboxylation of amino acids with the participation of bacteria. A method based on high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC–DAD) for the determination of eight biogenic amines in ripened meat products was developed and validated. Biogenic amines were extracted with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid and pre-column derivatized with dansyl chloride at 60 °C for 15 min, extracted with toluene, and dried under a stream of nitrogen. After reconstitution in acetonitrile, the extract was subjected to clean-up by dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE) using Z-Sep+ sorbent. The method was validated with the BAs at three concentration levels: 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg. The limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 1.51 to 2.20 mg/kg, and limit of quantification (LOQ) was between 5.08 and 7.34 mg/kg. The obtained correlation coefficients (R
                     2) ranged from 0.9997 to 0.9999 for all BAs. The precision (RSDr) values were < 20% and the recovery values for all amines were in the satisfactory range of 70–120% The developed method was applied to the analysis of 39 ripened meat products samples as retailed in Poland.
