Title: Development and validation of a multi-class analysis of pesticides in corn products by comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry

Abstract: Due to the growing trend of organic food, there is still concern over the use of chemicals and pesticides in agriculture. In recent years, several procedures have been validated for the control of pesticides in food. In the present research, a comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry is proposed for the first time for a multi-class analysis of 112 pesticides in corn-based products. Notably, a “reduced” QuEChERS-based method as extraction and clean-up procedure prior to the analysis, was successfully employed. Limits of quantification values were lower than the ones fixed by the European legislation; intra-day and inter-day precision were lower than 12.9% and 15.1%, respectively (at the 500 μg/kg concentration levels). Over 70% of the analytes provided recoveries between 70% and 120% range (at 50, 500 and 1000 µg/kg concentration levels) with standard deviation values below 20%. In addition, matrix effect values were in the range between 13% to 161%. The method was applied to the analysis of real samples, and three pesticides were detected at trace levels in both samples. The findings of this work pave the way for the treatment of complex matrices such as corn products.
