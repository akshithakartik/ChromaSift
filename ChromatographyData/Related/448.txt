Title: Mono-PEGylated lysozyme purification with increased productivity and isomer differentiation through heparin monolith chromatography

Abstract: PEGylated protein purification with the required quality attributes has represented a bioengineering challenge and Affinity Monolith Chromatography (AMC) has never been exploited for this goal. This work reports the generation of a heparin-modified affinity monolith disk by reductive alkylation with raised ligand density for its use as chromatographic support in the separation of lysozyme PEGylation reactions (LPRs) with three different PEG sizes (1, 20 and 40 kDa). For immobilized heparin determination a modified toluidine colorimetric assay adapted to microplate format was proposed. The heparin modified-disk was able to differentiate positional isomers of 20 kDa mono-PEGylated lysozyme at neutral pH using a salt linear gradient. Identity of PEG-conjugates was verified by SDS-PAGE and positional isomers were partially characterized by peptide mapping mass spectrometry. 20 kDa mono-PEGylated lysozyme conjugate purity (99.69 ± 0.05%) was comparable with traditional chromatographic methods while productivity (0.0964 ± 0.0001 mg/mL*min) was increased up to 6.1 times compared to that obtained in heparin packed-bed affinity chromatography procedures. The proposed AMC method represents a reliable, efficient, easy-handling, fast and single-step operation for the analysis or preparative isolation of PEGylated proteins containing a heparin binding domain.
