Title: Closing the gap: Ion chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry to trace highly polar anionic substances in groundwater

Abstract: Persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT), and very persistent and very mobile (vPvM) substances pose a threat to the water cycle but are often not covered in conventional environmental monitoring programs. Within this realm of substances, one compound class of concern are pesticides and their transformation products as they are deliberately introduced into the environment. To detect very polar anionic substances, including many pesticide transformation products with log DOW values ranging between −7.4 and 2.2, an ion chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry method was developed in this study. Since inorganic anions, such as chloride and sulfate, interfere with the analysis of organic species, their removal via precipitation with Ba/Ag/H cartridges was assessed. To improve LOQs, vacuum-assisted evaporative concentration (VEC) was evaluated. By using VEC and removing inorganic salt ions, the median LOQ improved from 100 ng/L in evian® water without sample treatment to 10 ng/L after enrichment and 30 ng/L in karst groundwater. Using this method, twelve out of 64 substances covered by the final method were found in karst groundwater in concentrations of up to 5600 ng/L, and seven exceeded 100 ng/L. To the authors' knowledge, the dimethenamid TP M31 and chlorothalonil TP SYN548008 were detected for the first time in groundwater samples. The coupling to a high-resolution mass spectrometer also allows for non-target screening and hence, this method presents a powerful tool to tackle PMT/vPvM substances.
