Title: Purification of a GalNAc-cluster-conjugated oligonucleotide by reversed-phase twin-column continuous chromatography

Abstract: Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP) is a continuous chromatography technique used to maximize purification yields compared to traditional batch purification methods. Here we apply MCSGP for the reversed phase purification of a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster-conjugated DNA-LNA gapmer oligonucleotide therapeutic using a twin-column chromatography system. Based on a batch process as a starting point, MCSGP was designed, optimized and compared with the batch process regarding process performance and scale-up requirements. Product yields increased from 52.7% using batch chromatography to 91.5% using MCSGP, with purity, productivity, and buffer consumption otherwise comparable. In a manufacturing scenario, use of MCSGP would allow the downscaling of oligonucleotide synthesis by 42.5%, which would result in a significant cost reduction and increased throughput. Moreover, the equipment, chemicals and methodology used in MCSGP are analogous to a standard reversed phase purification allowing for a “like for like” transition to the upgraded MCSGP process.
