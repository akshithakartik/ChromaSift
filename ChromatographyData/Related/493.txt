Title: Development of a method for analysis and risk assessment of residual pesticides in ginseng using liquid and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry

Abstract: In this study, we developed a method for detecting 335 pesticides in ginseng using liquid chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Additionally, the linearity, sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy, and precision of the method was validated. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) for the instrument used in these experiments was 0.1–5.8 μg/kg and 0.3–17.5 μg/kg, respectively. The average recovery was 71.6–113.4%. From 2016 to 2019, 467 ginseng samples were analyzed, of which 304 samples detected pesticide residues, but most of them were below the standard. It can be observed that the hazard quotient (HQ) of ginseng for detected pesticides was less than 1, thus implying that the risk was low. Hence, in this study, we developed a specific, reliable, and suitable method for a fast and simultaneous analysis of 335 pesticides in ginseng.
