Title: Analytical Methods Based on the Mass Balance Approach for Purity Evaluation of Tetracycline Hydrochloride.

Abstract: Analytical methods based on the mass balance approach were developed for the purity evaluation of tetracycline hydrochloride, a representative salt compound used in pure veterinary drug analysis. The purity assignment method was used to quantify individual classes of impurities via independent analytical techniques. The mass fraction of the free base or salt form contained in a high-purity organic compound with a hydrochloride salt can be determined. The chloride content by ion chromatography-conductivity detector (IC-CD) and general classes of impurities, including structurally related impurities by liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (LC-UV) detector, water by Karl Fischer (KF) coulometric titration, residual solvents by headspace sampler gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS), and non-volatiles by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), were considered to calculate the purity of the mass fraction. The chloride content of the salt compound can be considered the main impurity in the mass fraction of the free base in the salt compound. A purity assay using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (q-NMR) as a direct determination method was performed to confirm the results of the mass balance method. The assigned purities of the tetracycline free form and its salt form in mass fraction were (898.80 \xc2\xb1 1.60) mg/g and (972.65 \xc2\xb1 1.58) mg/g, respectively, which are traceable to the international system of units (SI). Thus, the procedure for evaluating the purity of the free base and salt forms in the salt compound is newly demonstrated in this study.
