Title: Three cases of xanthinuria identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based urine metabolomics.

Abstract: &lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;Early diagnosis of patients with urolithiasis or hypouricemia owing to inborn errors of hypoxanthine metabolism is important in preventing renal failure or drug-induced toxicity.&lt;h4&gt;Case presentation&lt;/h4&gt;We identified three patients with xanthinuria using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based urine metabolomics: a 72-year-old male with bladder stone, a severe hypouricemic 59-year-old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and an 8-year and 9-month-old female who was first discovered to harbor a mutation in the xanthine dehydrogenase gene using whole-exome sequencing, but had a normal molybdenum cofactor sulfurase gene. Hydantoin-5-propionate was detected in the first and third patients but not in the second, suggesting that the first and second patients had type I and II xanthinuria, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomics can be used for undiagnosed patients with xanthinuria, identification of the type of xanthinuria without allopurinol loading, and the quick functional evaluation of mutations in the xanthinuria-related genes.
