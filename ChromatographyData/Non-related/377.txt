Abstract: Ammonia represents one of most promising zero-carbon energy solutions to address the increasingly urgent climate change problem. However, the existing utilization of ammonia faces significant challenges from low chemical reactivity and high

A sustainable and energy-efficient approach to tackle the above challenges is low temperature plasma which enables non-equilibrium energy and chemical utilization of ammonia such as oxidation using renewable electricity. As such, this work, for the first time, explores plasma assisted ammonia oxidation at room temperature with a focus on unveiling non-equilibrium
