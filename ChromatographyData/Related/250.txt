Title: Continuous protein refolding and purification by two-stage periodic counter-current chromatography

Abstract: Matrix-assisted refolding (MAR) has been used as an alternative to conventional dilution-based refolding to improve recovery and reduce specific buffer consumption. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been extensively used for MAR because of its ability to load and refold proteins at high concentrations. However, the SEC-based batch MAR processes have the disadvantages of requiring longer columns for better separation and product dilution due to a high column-to-sample volume ratio. In this work, a modified operational scheme is developed for continuous MAR of L-asparaginase inclusion bodies (IBs) using SEC-based periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC). The volumetric productivity of the modified SEC-PCC process is 6.8-fold higher than the batch SEC process. In addition, the specific buffer consumption decreased by 5-fold compared to the batch process. However, the specific activity of the refolded protein (110–130 IU/mg) was less due to the presence of impurities and additives in the refolding buffer. To address this challenge, a 2-stage process was developed for continuous refolding and purification of IBs using different matrices in sequential PCCs. The performance of the 2-stage process is compared with literature reports on single-stage IMAC-PCC and conventional pulse dilution processes for refolding L-asparaginase IBs. The 2-stage process resulted in a refolded protein with enhanced specific activity (175–190 IU/mg) and a high recovery of 84%. The specific buffer consumption (6.2 mL/mg) was lower than the pulse dilution process and comparable to the single-stage IMAC-PCC. A seamless integration of the two stages would considerably increase the throughput without compromising other parameters. High recovery, throughput, and increased operational flexibility make the 2-stage process an attractive option for protein refolding.
