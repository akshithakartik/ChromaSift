Title: &lt;i&gt;Ganoderma adspersum&lt;/i&gt; (Ganodermataceae): Investigation of Its Secondary Metabolites and the Antioxidant, Antimicrobial, and Cytotoxic Potential of Its Extracts.

Abstract: &lt;i&gt;Ganoderma&lt;/i&gt; is a genus of wood-degrading mushrooms with medicinal importance. Most &lt;i&gt;Ganoderma&lt;/i&gt; species have been studied extensively for their secondary metabolites, biological activities, and ecological value. In this study, the biological activities of the extracts of &lt;i&gt;G. adspersum&lt;/i&gt; growing wild on &lt;i&gt;Morus alba&lt;/i&gt; trees in the region of Western Thrace (Greece) were evaluated, and the petroleum ether, dichloromethanolic, and methanolic extracts were studied further for their secondary metabolites. Six substances were isolated by chromatographic (Clumn Chromatography (C.C.), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)) and spectroscopic methods (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)), which were classified in the following categories: (a) unsaturated fatty acids: &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;oleic acid (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;); (b) sterols: ergosta-7,22-dien-3-one (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), ergosta-7,22-dien-3-ol (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), and ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3-ol (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;); and (c) lanostane-type triterpenoids: applanoxidic acid G (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) and applanoxidic acid A (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;). Finally, the biological activities of the extracts were estimated for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic potential. The methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;G. adspersum&lt;/i&gt; showed the highest total antioxidant activity. The results of the antimicrobial activities indicated that all of the extracts had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging between 39.1 and 312.5 \xce\xbcg/mL. The evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of the samples showed once again that the methanolic extract was the most potent among the examined extracts, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values of 19.22 \xce\xbcg/mL (Hep2c cells), 32.9 \xce\xbcg/mL (RD cells), and 8.94 \xce\xbcg/mL (L2OB cells). Moreover, the bioactivity scores of the isolated secondary metabolites were calculated using the online computer software program Molinspiration. The compounds showed promising bioactivity scores for drug targets.
