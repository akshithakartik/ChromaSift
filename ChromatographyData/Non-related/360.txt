Title: Response of dissolved organic matter chemistry to flood control of a large river reservoir during an extreme storm event

Abstract: With the frequent occurrence of extreme floods under global climate change-induced storm events, reservoir operation has been highlighted for river flood control, complicating the transport and transformation of riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM), one of the largest reactive carbon pools on earth. In particular, the response of riverine DOM chemistry to reservoir flood control during extreme storm events is still unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, the mechanism of DOM variation in Yangtze River with the world's largest Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) operation during an extreme storm event was explored. Optical and molecular properties of DOM varied significantly from upstream to downstream in non-TGR area, while no significant variation in DOM chemistry was observed in TGR area. The results uncovered a short time transformation of DOM from non-TGR area to TGR area, demonstrating that although storm event induced chemodiversity bloom of riverine DOM, flood control of TGR “re-constrained” DOM to more similar chemistry mainly under the influence of turbidity involved DOM transformation (e.g., adsorption/desorption and flocculation). Furthermore, combined with the hydrological information, we found that although TGR temporarily blocked dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flow during the flood event, the abundance of biologically recalcitrant DOC increased in TGR, which would contribute to its further transportation to downstream watershed. This study emphasizes the impact of TGR on extreme storm event-induced DOM dynamics, which also hints a better understanding of the crucial role of anthropogenic activity in affecting carbon cycling under extreme climate change.
