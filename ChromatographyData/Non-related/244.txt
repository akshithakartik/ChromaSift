Title: Coastal upwelling influences population structure of dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus: An integrative approach based on otolith chemistry and muscle stable isotopes

Abstract: The dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus) is an overfished and threatened fish species with coastal distribution. In the Southwestern Atlantic, it occurs across a broad region influenced by two major oceanographic features: the Cabo Frio (23°S) and the Cabo Santa Marta (28°S) upwelling systems. Along the Brazilian coast, the species may present continuous or discrete populations, depending on the methodological approach used. In this study we combined otolith chemistry and muscle stable isotope analyses to examine the population structure of dusky groupers and its association with the two upwelling systems. Fish were collected in shallow coastal waters of the Southwest Atlantic Ocean, covering the southeastern and southern Brazilian coasts, among Macaé (22°S), Santos (24°S), Florianópolis (27°S), and in Rio Grande (32°S). The results show three statistically well-separated population groups along the region. We named these population groups as North (north of Cabo Frio); Center (between upwelling regions); and South (south of the Cabo Santa Marta system). Our findings allow to suggest that the upwelling systems may influence the distribution of E. marginatus stocks along the Brazilian south-western coast, even though a causal effect may not be attributed at this point. Overall, this combined approach, leveraging information from distinct natural tags, and reflecting variability of water chemistry and food webs with latitude, allowed us to enhance our understanding on how major upwelling systems influence the structuring of fish populations along the southwestern Atlantic Ocean.
