Title: Temporal scale-bridging of chemistry in a multiscale model: Application to reactivity of an energetic material

Abstract: A heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) to evolve chemistry across disparate temporal scales is presented. The method directly couples a particle-based, microscale coarse-grain chemistry model to a macroscale continuum finite element model of deformation. The macroscale model obtains both the material equation-of-state and instantaneous chemical reaction rates through evaluation of the microscale model subject to distinct boundary conditions. The approach is demonstrated through several simulations of the energetic material 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (RDX) subject to slow heating, including a simulation inspired by the scaled thermal explosion (STEX) experiment.
