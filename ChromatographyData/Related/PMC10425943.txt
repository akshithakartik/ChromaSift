Title: Development of in-line anoxic small-angle X-ray scattering and structural characterization of an oxygen-sensing transcriptional regulator.

Abstract: Oxygen-sensitive metalloenzymes are responsible for many of the most fundamental biochemical processes in nature, from the reduction of dinitrogen in nitrogenase to the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments. However, biophysical characterization of such proteins under anoxic conditions can be challenging, especially at noncryogenic temperatures. In this study, we introduce the first in-line anoxic small-angle X-ray scattering (anSAXS) system at a major national synchrotron source, featuring both batch-mode and chromatography-mode capabilities. To demonstrate chromatography-coupled anSAXS, we investigated the oligomeric interconversions of the fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) transcription factor, which is responsible for the transcriptional response to changing oxygen conditions in the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli. Previous work has shown that FNR contains a labile [4Fe-4S] cluster that is degraded when oxygen is present and that this change in cluster composition leads to the dissociation of the DNA-binding dimeric form. Using anSAXS, we provide the first direct structural evidence for the oxygen-induced dissociation of the E.\xc2\xa0coli FNR dimer and its correlation with cluster composition. We further demonstrate how complex FNR-DNA interactions can be studied by investigating the promoter region of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase genes, nrdDG, which contains tandem FNR-binding sites. By coupling size-exclusion chromatography-anSAXS with full-spectrum UV-Vis analysis, we show that the [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing dimeric form of FNR can bind to both sites in the nrdDG promoter region. The development of in-line anSAXS greatly expands the toolbox available for the study of complex metalloproteins and provides a foundation for future expansions.
