Title: Determination of glutathione and glutathione disulfide using liquid chromatography: A review on recent applications

Abstract: Glutathione is the most abundant antioxidant in living organisms and plays an important role in cells due to its free thiol group. Under oxidative conditions, glutathione is oxidized to glutathione disulfide. The glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio determines the cell redox status and is associated with various human diseases, such as neurodegenerative, pulmonary, and immune diseases. High-performance liquid chromatography has been widely used for the determination of these analytes in various samples such as biological, vegetables, plant tissues, wines and yeasts. Derivatization is an important step for glutathione assay, to form stable and sensitive derivatives, for detection through ultraviolet, fluorescence, or mass spectrometry, as well. This review focuses on the developed methods for the determination of glutathione and its disulfide in various samples using liquid chromatography, covering the period from 2005 to middle-2023.
