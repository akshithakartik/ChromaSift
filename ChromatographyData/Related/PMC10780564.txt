Title: Isolation and Purification of Protamine from the Cultured &lt;i&gt;Takifugu flavidus&lt;/i&gt; and Its Physicochemical Properties.

Abstract: Protamine is a cationic peptide derived from fish sperm and has several important functional properties: antibacterial properties, acting as a carrier for injectable insulin and as a heparin antagonist, combatting fatigue, etc. Thus, it has been widely used in medicinal applications and food products. Cultured &lt;i&gt;Takifugu flavidus&lt;/i&gt; is a type of pufferfish with a delicious taste that is popular in China, and its production is increasing significantly. Therefore, protamine was extracted via acid extraction from the sperm of &lt;i&gt;Takifugu flavidus&lt;/i&gt; and further isolated and purified via sephadex gel chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and desalination chromatography. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of protamine were investigated. The results showed that the sperm of the cultured &lt;i&gt;T. flavidus&lt;/i&gt; were non-toxic, and the extracted and purified protamine had high contents of arginine (36.90%) and lysine (27.02%), respectively. The secondary structure of protamine was mainly \xce\xb2-folded and irregularly curled. Additionally, protamine exhibited high thermal stability with a denaturation temperature of 176 \xc2\xb0C. This study would provide a theoretical basis for the structural analysis, bioactivity, and resource development of pufferfish protamine and help to promote the development of the pufferfish industry.
