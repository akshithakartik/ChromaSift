Title: Combining IP3 affinity chromatography and bioinformatics reveals a novel protein-IP3 binding site on Plasmodium falciparum MDR1 transporter

Abstract: Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization induced by second messenger IP3 controls many cellular events in most of the eukaryotic groups. Despite the increasing evidence of IP3-induced Ca2+ in apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium, responsible for malaria infection, no protein with potential function as an IP3-receptor has been identified. The use of bioinformatic analyses based on previously known sequences of IP3-receptor failed to identify potential IP3-receptor candidates in any Apicomplexa. In this work, we combine the biochemical approach of an IP3 affinity chromatography column with bioinformatic meta-analyses to identify potential vital membrane proteins that present binding with IP3 in Plasmodium falciparum. Our analyses reveal that PF3D7_0523000, a gene that codes a transport protein associated with multidrug resistance as a potential target for IP3. This work provides a new insight for probing potential candidates for IP3-receptor in Apicomplexa.
