Title: Unraveling the Formation Mechanism of Egg\'s Unique Flavor via Flavoromics and Lipidomics.

Abstract: Egg products after thermal treatment possess a unique flavor and are favored by consumers. In this study, the key aroma-active compounds of egg yolk products and their formation mechanism during thermal treatment were investigated. The volatile aroma compounds in egg yolks were monitored using an electronic nose, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC-O-MS), and the lipid molecular species were explored using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry with a Q-Exactive HF-X Orbitrap (UPLC-Q-Exactive HF-X). A total of 68 volatile compounds were identified. Boiled eggs mainly derived their flavor from hexanal, 2-pentyl-furan, 2-butanone, 3-methyl-butanal and heptane. Meanwhile, fried eggs relied mainly on 14 compounds, the most important of which were 2-ethyl-3-methyl-pyrazine, 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-pyrazine, nonanal and 2,3-diethyl-5-methyl-pyrazine, providing a baked and burnt sugar flavor. A total of 201 lipid molecules, belonging to 21 lipid subclasses, were identified in egg yolks, and 13 oxidized lipids were characterized using a molecular network. Phosphoethanolamines (PEs) containing polyunsaturated fatty acids were the primary flavor precursors contributing to the development of egg yolks\' flavor, participating in lipid oxidation reactions and the Maillard reaction and regulating the production of aldehydes and pyrazine compounds. This study provides reference and guidance for the development of egg yolk flavor products.
