Title: Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization mass spectrometry combined with fabric phase sorptive extraction for therapeutic drug monitoring of pioglitazone, repaglinide, and nateglinide in human plasma

Abstract: Polypharmacy in type 2 diabetes is an issue of major concern as the prescription of multiple medi-cations for the management of diabetes-associated comorbidities can lead to drug-to-drug interactions, which can pose serious risks to patients’ health. Within this context, the development of bioanalytical methods for monitoring the therapeutic levels of antidiabetic drugs is notably useful to ensure patients’ safety. In the present work, a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry method for the quantitation of pioglitazone, repaglinide, and nateglinide in human plasma is described. Sample preparation was performed by fabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE), and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) was implemented for the chromatographic separation of the analytes, using a ZIC®-cHILIC analytical column (150 × 2.1 mm, 3 µm) under isocratic elution. The mobile phase consisted of 10 mM ammonium formate aqueous solution (pH = 6.5)/ acetonitrile, 10/90 v/v, and was pumped at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min−1. Design of Experiments was used during the development of the sample preparation method to gain deeper insight into the effect of various experimental parameters on extraction efficiency, their potential interactions and to optimize the recovery rates of the analytes. The linearity of the assay was assessed over the ranges of 25 to 2000, 6.25 to 500, and 125 to 10000 ng mL−1 for pioglitazone, repaglinide, and nateglinide, respectively. The presented method was fully validated and can be used for the therapeutic monitoring of the targeted analytes in human plasma samples.
