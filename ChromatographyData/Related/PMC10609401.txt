Title: Advancements in Preprocessing and Analysis of Nitrite and Nitrate since 2010 in Biological Samples: A Review.

Abstract: As a substance present in organisms, nitrite is a metabolite of nitric oxide and can also be ingested. Nitrate is the metabolite of nitrite. Therefore, it is necessary to measure it quickly, easily and accurately to evaluate the health status of humans. Although there have been several reviews on analytical methods for non-biological samples, there have been no reviews focused on both sample preparation and analytical methods for biological samples. First, rapid and accurate nitrite measurement has significant effects on human health. Second, the detection of nitrite in biological samples is problematic due to its very low concentration and matrix interferences. Therefore, the pretreatment plus measuring methods for nitrite and nitrate obtained from biological samples since 2010 are summarized in the present review, and their prospects for the future are proposed. The treatment methods include liquid-liquid microextraction, various derivatization reactions, liquid-liquid extraction, protein precipitation, solid phase extraction, and cloud point extraction. Analytical methods include spectroscopic methods, paper-based analytical devices, ion chromatography, liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, electrochemical methods, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis. Derivatization reagents with rapid quantitative reactions and advanced extraction methods with high enrichment efficiency are also included. Nitrate and nitrate should be determined at the same time by the same analytical method. In addition, much exploration has been performed on formulating fast testing through microfluidic technology. In this review, the newest developments in nitrite and nitrate processing are a focus in addition to novel techniques employed in such analyses.
