Title: A comprehensive evaluation of milk protein molecular weight distribution based on exclusion chromatography dataset

Abstract: Molecular weight is one of the main characteristic parameters of proteins, which is the basis for the functional properties of milk protein. This research aims at establishing molecular weight distribution pattern of milk protein based on exclusion chromatography. The method selected Na3PO4-Na2SO4 (0.1 M, pH 6.7) buffer as the mobile phase and detected at 220 nm by HPLC-UV. The protein molecular weight distributions were determined and compared for human milk, bovine milk, and infant formula. The proportion of macromolecular proteins is much higher in infant formula compared to human or bovine milk. The protein molecular weights of human and bovine milk are significantly different around 90, 20, 14, and 2 kDa. The results provide holistic compare of bovine milk, human milk, and infant formula through protein molecular distribution. The new evaluation indicators for protein will drive technological simulation of infant formula.
