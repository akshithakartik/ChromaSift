Title: Fabric phase sorptive extraction combined with dispersive liquid-liquid extraction for the extraction of some pesticide residues from fruit juices using partially carbonized cotton textile followed by gas chromatography–flame ionization detector

Abstract: A piece of carbonized cotton textile (denim) was prepared and shown to be a viable sorbent for the fabric phase sorptive extraction of pesticide residues from various fruit juices. The presented sorbent was made by heating the acidified cotton textile in a furnace. The raw material used was readily accessible, green, and natural. The extracted analytes were more enriched using a liquid phase microextraction technique and quantified by gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector. Under the optimum conditions, the limits of detection and quantification were in the ranges of 0.31–0.51 and 1.0–1.5 µg L−1, respectively. Satisfactory linearity for the calibration curves with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.995 to 0.997 was observed. Five replicated analyses were performed during the same day (intra-day precision) and five consecutive days (inter-day precision) and the obtained relative standard deviations for intra- and inter-day precisions were equal to or less than 8%. Relative recoveries of the analytes varied between 91 % and 103 % with relative standard deviations in the range of 3–6 %. The sorbent was reused for up to 12 analyses without significant loss of extraction efficiency and has a potential to be a useful and low–cost alternative to existing sorbents.
