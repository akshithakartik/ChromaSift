Title: Caffeic acid recarbonization: A green chemistry, sustainable carbon nano material platform to intervene in neurodegeneration induced by emerging contaminants

Abstract: Environmental agents such as pesticides, weedicides and herbicides (collectively referred to as pesticides) are associated with the onset and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD) diseases. The development of blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating therapeutic candidates to both prevent and treat the aforementioned xenotoxicant-induced neurodegenerative disorders remains an unmet need. Here, we examine whether caffeic-acid based Carbon Quantum Dots (CACQDs) can intervene in pesticide-associated onset and progress of the PD phenotype. Pulse-chase fluorescence analyses revealed that CACQDs intervene in the soluble-to-toxic transformation of the amyloid-forming protein model Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL). The sp2-rich CACQDs also scavenged free radicals, a milestone along the PD trajectory. In-vitro, CACQDs introduced into a human neuroblastoma-derived cell line (SH-SY5Y) demonstrated negligible cytotoxicity up to 5Â mg/mL and protected the cell line against oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury induced by the pesticide and potent neurotoxin, paraquat. Our findings suggest that the potentially BBB-penetrating CACQDs derived from caffeic acid hold promise for mitigating neurodegenerative disorders associated with environmental pesticides and xenobiotic neurotoxicants. Importantly, CACQDs sourced from coffee, coupled with their facile synthesis, represent a sustainable, green chemistry platform for generating interventional candidates in neurodegeneration.
