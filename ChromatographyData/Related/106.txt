Title: Affinity character analysis of magnolol and honokiol based on stepwise frontal analysis coupled with cell membrane chromatography

Abstract: Magnolol and honokiol have been reported to exhibit anti-cancer activity. However, few studies are in relation to the interaction of magnolol/honokiol with vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGFR2). In this study, a membrane chromatography method based on VEGFR2 was established for the interaction characteristic analysis between drug and receptor. The selectivity, repeatability and stability of the chromatographic model were evaluated using drugs acting on different receptors. The affinity between VEGFR2 and magnolol/honokiol was verified by cell membrane chromatography. The binding sites of magnolol/honokiol and VEGFR2 were analyzed by zonal elution. Especially, the dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) of magnolol/honokiol and VEGFR2 were measured by zonal elution and stepwise frontal analysis respectively. In addition, the actions of magnolol/honokiol on VEGFR2 were analyzed by stepwise frontal analysis at different temperatures. The results showed that the binding sites of magnolol and honokiol on VEGFR2 were different from sorafenib, indicating that magnolol and honokiol could be used as competitive agents for self-competitive displacement experiment. The Kd values (order of magnitude) of magnolol/honokiol with VEGFR2 measured by stepwise frontal analysis were consistent with the zonal elution results. Honokiol binds VEGFR2 with higher affinity than magnolol. The main forces that stabilize the interactions of honokiol with VEGFR2 are hydrogen bonds and van der Waalâ€™s forces, and the main force of magnolol is electrostatic forces. These discoveries could assist in the prediction of drug activity and understanding for the underlying mechanism.
