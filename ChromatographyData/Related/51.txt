Title: Green method for determination of four anti-viral drugs using micellar liquid chromatography: Application to dosage form analysis

Abstract: A micellar liquid chromatographic (MLC) method was developed to separate and analyze four anti-viral drugs. The method utilized a Thermo Hypersil ODS C18 HPLC column with an isocratic elution mode employing a mobile phase consisting of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.15 M, pH 3), isopropanol and triethylamine (79.7:20:0.3, v/v/v). The Design Expert 8® software was used to optimize four factors simultaneously and the developed quadratic D-optimal model could achieve maximum resolution between peaks while minimizing the run time. The method was found linear over the concentration ranges of 10–100 μg/mL for sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, and 20–200 μg/mL for ledipasvir and velpatasvir, and successfully applied to the analysis of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in tablets. The MLC method was compared with a previously reported high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using the analytical GREEnness metric approach (AGREE), and was found to exhibit greener performance due to the use of safer reagents. The results indicate the high potential of micellar liquid chromatography in the separation of quaternary mixtures with the aid of response surface methodologies.
