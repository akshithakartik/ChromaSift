Title: Obtaining acidic and basic charge variants using a twin-column continuous chromatography system

Abstract: For recombinantly produced monoclonal antibody (mAb), charge variants including acidic and basic species are common heterogeneities. For characterization purpose, sufficient amount of acidic and basic species with high purity is needed. In this work, we developed an approach that allows for continuous separating and collecting of acidic and basic charge variants. First, with batch-mode cation exchange (CEX) chromatography, the load density and linear salt gradient elution conditions under which good separation of both charge variants can be achieved were determined. Next, a stepwise elution protocol was developed based on the linear gradient elution. Finally, acidic and basic charge variants were persistently produced under stepwise elution using a customized twin-column continuous chromatography system. This approach allows acidic and basic charge variants with high purity (i.e., >90%) to be efficiently generated in sufficient amount, which greatly facilitates the necessary characterization of these mAb variants.
