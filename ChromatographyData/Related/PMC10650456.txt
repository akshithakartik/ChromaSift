Title: Simultaneous Analysis of Hydrophobic Atractylenolides, Atractylon and Hydrophilic Sugars in Bai-Zhu Using a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Column Tandem Technique.

Abstract: An analytical method was established using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array and evaporative light scattering detectors (HPLC-DAD-ELSD) with -C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; and -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; column tandem for the simultaneous determination of hydrophobic atractylenolide I, II, III, atractylone and hydrophilic compounds glucose, fructose and sucrose in the dried rhizome of &lt;i&gt;Atractylodes macrocephala&lt;/i&gt; Koidz (a natural raw material for health foods, Bai-Zhu &lt;i&gt;aka&lt;/i&gt;. in Chinese). The method combines the different separation capabilities of reversed-phase liquid chromatography and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. It can provides a new choice for the simultaneous determination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds in traditional Chinese medicines and health foods. It provided a reference method for the quality control of Bai-Zhu. The results showed that the linear correlation coefficients of the established column tandem chromatographic method were all greater than 0.9990, the relative standard deviation was 0.1-2.8%, and the average recovery was 96.7-103.1%. The contents of atractylenolide I, II, III, atractylone, fructose, glucose, and sucrose in 17 batches of Baizhu were 172.3-759.8 \xce\xbcg/g, 201.4-612.8 \xce\xbcg/g, 160.3-534.2 \xce\xbcg/g, 541.4-8723.1 \xce\xbcg/g, 6.9-89.7 mg/g, 0.7-7.9 mg/g, and 1.2-21.0 mg/g, respectively.
