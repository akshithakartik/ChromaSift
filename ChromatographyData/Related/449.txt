Title: Sustainable chromatographic purification of milbemectin: Application of high-speed countercurrent chromatography coupled with off-line atmospheric pressure solid analysis probe-high resolution mass spectrometry

Abstract: Isolation of valuable chemicals is an important process in reagent manufacturing for the pharmaceutical and food science industries. This process is traditionally time-consuming, expensive, and consumes vast amounts of organic solvents. Considering green chemistry and sustainability concerns, we sought to develop a sustainable chromatographic purification methodology for obtaining antibiotics by focusing on the reduction of organic solvent waste generation. Milbemectin (mixture of milbemycin A3 and milbemycin A4) was successfully purified using high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) and pure fractions (>98% purity, HPLC) could be identified using the organic solvent fee atmospheric pressure solid analysis probe mass spectrometry (ASAP-MS). The organic solvents required for HSCCC could be redistilled and recycled for continued HSCCC purification, thus reducing the consumption of organic solvent (n-hexane/ethyl acetate) by 80+%. Optimization of the two-phase solvent system (n-hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water, 9/1/7/3, v/v/v/v) for HSCCC was assisted computationally, thereby reducing solvent waste from an experimental determination. Our proposal application of HSCCC and offline ASAP-MS provides proof of concept for a sustainable, preparative scale, chromatographic purification methodology for obtaining antibiotics in high purity.
