               Indica

Abstract: The colossal significance of nanostructured materials and their implications is a coherent incentive for the exploration of novel conventional techniques. This brings attention to the major problem in developing nanomaterials i.e. the hazardous nature of reactants used. The hazardous reactants are harmful to the environment. So here, biogenic synthesis of nanostructured materials utilizing natural herb extracts has enthralled prodigious implications owing to its rapid, clean, eco-friendly, non-toxic, cost-effective, and as a flipside pathway to several chemical and physiochemical approaches. Titanium oxide materials have been the cynosure for several propitious implications due to their low cost, availability, chemical stability, and biocompatibility. Herein, we developed an efficient green chemistry method for the synthesis of titanium oxide nanoparticles utilizing neem (Azadirachta Indica) extracts. The X-ray diffraction studies revealed the polycrystalline titanium oxide (rutile) structure. The spherical shape of the nanoparticles was observed in TEM and SEM images and their size ranged from 10 to 20 nm. UV–vis studies showed an exciton emission peak at about 380 nm while the IR transmission spectrum revealed the characteristic stretching modes of TiO2. It is envisioned that this novel route for the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles could be more beneficial in comparison to other conventional approaches. As the greener approach is being carried out in this paper, therefore, the toxic byproduct is not being released.
