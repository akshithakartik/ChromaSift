Title: Discrimination potential of otolith chemistry to distinguish two parapatric species of flounder (Platichthys) in the Baltic Sea

Abstract: Baltic Sea flounder were recently split into two species, the offshore spawner Platichthys flesus and coastal spawner Platichthys solemdali. The two species can only be distinguished based on egg and sperm characteristics and via genetic analyses, which limits the species identification methods of larvae and juveniles to molecular techniques. We investigated whether otolith chemistry could be used as an additional tool to identify flounder to species level. We tested for species-specific differences in otolith multi-elemental signatures and spatial consistency of those differences for the early life stages of flounder in three areas of the central Baltic Sea (ICES SD 24â€“28), where the distribution of both species overlaps. Otolith chemistry signatures obtained through maternal transfer (i.e. core chemistry) and signatures that reflect the post-hatching phase were not significantly different between species. Species-specific differences at the sub-regional scale were only found for the Latvian coastal survey area for multiple elements (Ba, Cu, Mg, Pb, Sr and Zn), but were insufficiently distinct for reliable species discrimination. Geographic classification of age-0 juveniles to survey area was more successful than classification to species, which was reflected by a spatial trend in otolith Sr:Ca that followed the salinity gradient and higher Mn:Ca and I:Ca for Latvian individuals. Otolith chemistry of early life flounder from the Baltic Sea reflects spatial variability in environmental conditions but does not differentiate between the two flounder species in sympatric habitats.
