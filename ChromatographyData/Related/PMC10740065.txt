Title: An overview of analytical methods employed for quality assessment of &lt;i&gt;Crocus sativus&lt;/i&gt; (saffron).

Abstract: This paper reviews qualitative and quantitative analytical methodologies used for the appraisal of saffron quality, as the most expensive spice. Due to the chemical diversity of biologically active compounds of the &lt;i&gt;Crocus&lt;/i&gt; genus, analytical methods with different features are required for their complete analysis. However, screening of the main components, such as carotenoids and flavonoids, appears to be sufficient for quality control, a more precise examination needs evaluation of minor compounds, including anthocyanins and fatty acids. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and thin-layer chromatography (TLC), are elementary and applicable methods in quality control analysis, whereas HPLC provides metabolite fingerprint and monitoring multi-compound instances at preparative and analytical levels. Combination approaches like metabolomics using different methods could classify saffron types, identify its adulterations, contaminants and provide a comprehensive metabolite map for quality control of selected compounds.
