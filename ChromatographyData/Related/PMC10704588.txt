Title: Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography at Subzero Temperature for Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry.

Abstract: Chromatographic separations at subzero temperature significantly improve the precision of back-exchange-corrected hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) determinations. Our previously reported dual-enzyme HDX-MS analysis instrument used reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) at -30 \xc2\xb0C, but high backpressures limited flow rates and required materials and equipment rated for very high pressures. Here, we report the design and performance of a dual-enzyme HDX-MS analysis instrument comprising a RPLC trap column and a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) analytical column in a two-dimensional RPLC-HILIC configuration at subzero temperature. During operation at -30 \xc2\xb0C, the HILIC column manifests greatly reduced backpressure, which enables faster analytical flow rates and the use of materials rated for lower maximum pressures. The average peptide eluted from a HILIC column during a 40 min gradient at -30 \xc2\xb0C contained \xe2\x89\x8813% more deuterium than peptides eluted from a tandem RPLC-RPLC apparatus using a conventional 8 min gradient at 0 \xc2\xb0C. A subset of peptides eluted from the HILIC apparatus contained \xe2\x89\x8824% more deuterium.
