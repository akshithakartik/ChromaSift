Title: Determination of hydrogen gas by 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene hydrogenation coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry

Abstract: Knowing the H2 concentration released from polymer materials is essential to understand the degradation degree of polymer materials. In this study, a novel strategy of 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene (DEB) hydrogenation in combination with gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) determination of hydrogen gas (H2) was developed. In this strategy, DEB was utilized to react with H2 for establishing the quantitative analysis method of H2. A H2 analysis platform that could accurately control H2 concentration was designed and fabricated to be used to establish the quantitative method of H2. The linear regression curve was established between the H2 standard and the MS signal of the reaction products on GC-MS. Finally, the H2 released from polyethylene under gamma radiation was detected by this method. This method could be a powerful auxiliary tool for studying the content changes of H2.
