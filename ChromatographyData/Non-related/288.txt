Title: Effect of an augmented reality app on academic achievement, motivation, and technology acceptance of university students of a chemistry course

Abstract: The purpose of the current research was to explore the effect of an augmented reality app on the academic level, motivation, and technology acceptance of students of a university-level chemistry course. The study followed a pre/post-test design with a control group. At the end of a lecture on carbon bonds, we requested 95 university students to develop three models using modeling clay. The experimental group used the augmented reality app, while the control group used 2D pictures. The academic achievement increased for the students who used the augmented reality app. Motivation scores were not different between the control and experimental group. Our results indicate that augmented reality technology could be helpful in an academic setting.
