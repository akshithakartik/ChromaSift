Title: Synthesis of organoselenium compounds using electrochemical and photochemical methods as novel approaches in organic chemistry

Abstract: Organoselenium chemistry has become a renewed topic in synthetic organic chemistry mainly because of its successful application in biological, medicinal, and material sciences. Yet, their application in organic synthesis is still in its early stages. In this review contribution we describe recent developments in electrochemistry and photochemistry applied to organoselenium synthesis. We highlight their environmentally sustainable properties involvinr catalytic processes. We emphasize the different approaches, oxidative and reducing processes by both methodologies. In addition, modern examples using continuous flow chemistry are included as a powerful tool to scale up these reactions are included.
