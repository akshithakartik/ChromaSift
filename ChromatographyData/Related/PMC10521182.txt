Title: Screening and quantification of antibiotic residues in poultry products and feed in selected areas of Bangladesh.

Abstract: &lt;h4&gt;Background and aim&lt;/h4&gt;Antibiotic residues in livestock farming have been identified as a potential cause of antimicrobial resistance in humans and animals. This study aimed to determine whether antibiotic residues were present in the chicken meat, eggs, feces, and feed collected from all four districts in the Mymensingh division of Bangladesh.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;To detect antibiotic residues in the collected samples, qualitative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used. A total of 230 samples were analyzed for antibiotic residues of commonly used 11 antibiotics. Out of these, 40 meat and 40 feces samples were collected from broilers and layers, 30 egg samples from ducks and layers, and 120 feed samples from broilers and layers from the study area. Thin-layer chromatography was used to screen the presence of antibiotic residues; TLC-positive samples were then subjected to further HPLC analysis to determine the residue concentrations.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Thin-layer chromatography analysis revealed that 23.5% of the tested samples contained residues from six different antibiotic classes (tetracyclines, quinolones, beta-lactams, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and macrolides). Thin-layer chromatography analysis showed that 35% and 25% of the meat samples were positive for residues from the broiler and layer, respectively. About 15% and 30% of layer and duck egg samples had positive residues, respectively. Out of 120 feed samples analyzed, about 15.8% had various antibiotic residues. In addition, feces samples from broilers and layers had 50% and 35% antibiotic residues, respectively. A total of 2.5% meat and 3.3% egg samples had antibiotic residues above the maximum residue limit (MRL). Based on the findings of this study, the highest percentage of oxytetracycline, followed by doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, were detected in feed samples, and oxytetracycline was detected in meat and egg samples.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This study clearly showed the misuse of antibiotics in the poultry sector in Bangladesh. Although antibiotic residues below the MRL level are suitable for human consumption, they may result in antimicrobial drug resistance to pathogens.
