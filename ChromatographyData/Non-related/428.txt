Title: Poly[n]catenane from reticular chemistry

Abstract: Poly[n]catenanes exhibit intriguing properties, while their synthesis is the primary challenge to explore their widespread applications. In a recent issue of Nat. Synth., Yaghi and co-workers report the synthesis of a series of three-dimensional [âˆž]catenane frameworks from reticular chemistry.
