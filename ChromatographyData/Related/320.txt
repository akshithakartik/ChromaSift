Title: One-pot derivatization/extraction coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for furfurals determination

Abstract: Furfurals (5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural and 5-methyl furfural) have potential toxic effects to humans. This study developed a simple and rapid one-pot derivatization/extraction procedure for effective sample preparation of furfurals in complex samples prior to instrument analysis. The sample solution was incubated with 1-pyrenebutyric hydrazide (PBH) and hydroxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-OH) in a vial for 3 min. During this process, the furfurals were effectively derivatized by PBH and the furfural-PBH derivatives were selectively captured by MWCNTs-OH simultaneously. The detection selectivity and accuracy were greatly improved for the following liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Quantifying furfurals was validated over the 0.5–500 ng/mL concentration range with satisfactory linearities (R2 >0.99), accuracies (84.7%–119.0%) and precisions (<9.0%). The limits of quantification of 0.30, 0.36 and 0.20 ng/mL for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural and 5-methyl furfural, respectively, were achieved. Finally, the validated method was successfully applied to determine furfurals concentrations in various samples.
