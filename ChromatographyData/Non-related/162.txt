Title: Greening the chemistry curriculum as a contribution to education for sustainable development: When and how to start?

Abstract: Chemistry's response to the demand for more sustainability in research and its related industries is laid down in the concepts of green and sustainable chemistry (GSC). GSC started to change the way chemistry is and should be operated in the 21st century. It is suggested that GSC implies that also change is needed to come regarding how chemistry is taught. This article reflects the right time to make learners familiar with the ideas of GSC, discusses selected strategies how ideas from GSC can be integrated with school science and chemistry curricula, and provides an illustrative insight into how teaching green chemistry principles can explicitly be implemented in the upper secondary schooling level.
