Title: A novel bacteriocin isolated from &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/i&gt; W3-2 and its biological characteristics.

Abstract: In this study, screening bacteriocin-producing strains from 2,000 plant-derived strains by agar well diffusion method was conducted. The corresponding produced bacteriocin was purified and identified by Sephadex gel chromatography, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Meanwhile, the biological characteristics of bacteriocin were investigated. The targeted strain W3-2 was obtained and identified as &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/i&gt; by morphological observation and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Correspondingly, a novel bacteriocin (named plantaricin W3-2) produced by &lt;i&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/i&gt; W3-2 with a molecular weight of 618.26 Da, and an amino acid sequence of AVEEE was separated, purified by Sephadex gel chromatography and RP-HPLC, and identified by LC-MS/MS. Further characteristics analysis displayed that plantaricin W3-2 had good thermal, pH stability, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial ability. In conclusion, plantaricin W3-2 can be used as a new food preservative.
