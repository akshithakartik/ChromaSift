Title: Simultaneous determination of enantiomer residues of metalaxyl and its metabolite metalaxyl acid in animal muscle tissues by chiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry

Abstract: The toxicity of the two enantiomers of metalaxyl is significantly different and, for food safety concerns, stereoselective analysis of its residues is extremely important in animal muscle tissues. Herein, a simple, sensitive and reproducible method for the simultaneous stereoselective analysis of metalaxyl and its metabolite metalaxyl acid in animal-derived foods has been established based on mixed-mode anion exchange solid phase extraction and chiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Under the optimized separation and sample pretreatment conditions, good linearity (r > 0.99) was obtained for four target analytes in four animal muscle tissues including bovine, chicken, swine and fish. Mean recoveries of all enantiomers in muscle tissue samples were 89.5–110.3 % with relative standard deviations below 12.4 %. The limits of quantification of the analytes were 0.3–1.0 µg/kg. The proposed method provides an effective means to monitor the enantiomer residues in real samples whether using highly active R-metalaxyl or racemic mixture drugs.
