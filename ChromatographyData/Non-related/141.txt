Title: Dynamic covalent chemistry toward wearable electronics

Abstract: Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) has become an important tool in developing smart materials in the past few decades. By incorporating reversible covalent bonds into crosslinked polymer networks, those features that are highly desired in wearable electronics, such as stretchability, malleability, self-healing capability, and closed-loop recyclability, could be achieved. In this perspective, we briefly summarize how DCvC influences the development of dynamic polymer networks and discuss their applications in wearable electronics. The advantages and challenges of wearable electronics with dynamic covalent features are also discussed. In addition, forward-thinking outlooks for future directions of utilizing DCvC in the development of wearable electronics are provided.
