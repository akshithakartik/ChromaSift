Title: Codon optimization of a gene encoding DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosus and its expression in Escherichia coli.

Abstract: &lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;DNA polymerase is an essential component in PCR assay for DNA synthesis. Improving DNA polymerase with characteristics indispensable for a powerful assay is crucial because it can be used in wide-range applications. Derived from Pyrococcus furiosus, Pfu DNA polymerase (Pfu pol) is one of the excellent polymerases due to its high fidelity. Therefore, we aimed to develop Pfu pol from a synthetic gene with codon optimization to increase its protein yield in Escherichia coli.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Recombinant Pfu pol was successfully expressed and purified with a two-step purification process using nickel affinity chromatography, followed by anion exchange chromatography. Subsequently, the purified Pfu pol was confirmed by Western blot analysis, resulting in a molecular weight of approximately 90\xc2\xa0kDa. In the final purification process, we successfully obtained a large amount of purified enzyme (26.8\xc2\xa0mg/L). Furthermore, the purified Pfu pol showed its functionality and efficiency when tested for DNA amplification using the standard PCR.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Overall, a high-level expression of recombinant Pfu pol was achieved by employing our approach in the present study. In the future, our findings will be useful for studies on synthesizing recombinant DNA polymerase in E. coli expression system.
