Title: Durable and comfortable superoleophobic fabrics utilizing ultra-short-chain fluorinated surface chemistry

Abstract: A superoleophobic textile treatment was designed for nylon fabrics based on perfluoropolyether chemistry. Treated fabrics showed superoleophobicity for n-hexadecane with a contact angle of 150° ± 4°, and a contact angle of 80° ± 5° for n-octane. The oil-repellent finish exhibited good washing fastness and could still repel n-decane after 10 washing cycles. The fabric finish also decreased the adhesion of a range of fouling solidifying substances including mud, ice, and cyanoacrylate glue, up to 6 times compared to the untreated textile. The tear resistance of treated fabric was statistically equivalent to that of the untreated fabric, and the treatment enhanced flame resistance up to 14%. The comfort properties were either unchanged or decreased minimally, as compared to the untreated fabric, indicating that the perfluoropolyether-based finish may be a suitable replacement for the short-chain and long-chain perfluoroalkylated substances used as oleophobic fabric finishes today.
