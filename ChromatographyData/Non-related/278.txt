Title: Selected Diastereoselective Reactions: Hypervalent Iodine Chemistry

Abstract: The chemistry of hypervalent iodine reagents has now become an asset for organic chemists due to their reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Hypervalent iodine reagents provide key assistance to organic synthesis due to their dual nature as powerful oxidants and electrophiles. The dual nature of these reagents is helpful of achieving variety of organic transformations such as the oxidation of different organic species, functionalization of carbonyl compounds in the Î±-position, cyclizations and rearrangements. Various organocatalytic reactions have been developed using hypervalent iodine catalysis. Additionally, several diastereoselective reactions have been investigated by using hypervalent iodine reagents. In this chapter, diastereoselective reactions assisted by hypervalent iodine reagents are discussed in detail.
