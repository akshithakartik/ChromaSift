Title: Rapid and sensitive simultaneous separation and electrochemical detection of tetracaine hydrochloride and oxymetazoline hydrochloride in pharmaceutical formulations via core-shell reversed-phase liquid chromatography

Abstract: Tetracaine hydrochloride (TCH) is a nasal anesthetic and oxymetazoline hydrochloride (OZH) is a nasal decongestant. A moderate to acute overdosage of OZH and TCH can lead to mydriasis, nausea, cyanosis, tachycardia, dyspnoea, cardiovascular failure, disorientation, seizures, and even death. Liquid chromatography (LC) has been mainly utilized for the individual determination of either TCH or OZH; however, there is a need for rapid and efficient methods for simultaneous analysis in pharmaceutical formulations and aqueous samples. This study highlights the use of the fast and efficient separation capabilities of core-shell silica particles in liquid chromatography (LC) for the simultaneous determination of TCH and OZH using UV detection and the enhanced selectivity afforded by electrochemical detection at a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode. Rapid reversed-phase (RP) separation and detection of OZH and TCH in nasal spray and eye drops was achieved within 45 s using a poroshell 120 EC-C18 column, by adjusting the ratio of organic solvent, mobile phase pH, detection potential and mobile phase flow rate. Sensitivity was compared using ultraviolet (UV) detection at 280 nm, and ECD at + 1.3 V with detection limits of 40 and 70 nM for TCH and OZH, respectively. The developed rapid method was utilized successfully in the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations, where the estimated levels of TCH and OZH in these formulations are in agreement with the specified values outlined by the manufacturers.
