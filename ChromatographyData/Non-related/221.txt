Title: 5.01 Introduction: Inorganic materials chemistry

Abstract: This volume addresses Inorganic Materials Chemistry with a specific focus on the role of synthesis in developing materials. The subset of inorganic materials that are the main focus of this volume are what are generally referred to as functional materials, i.e. materials that carry out a function through the manner in which they respond to an external stimulus. The contributions in this volume address (with a synthesis focus) a range of topics from hybrid framework materials, the use of hydride materials as precursors in materials synthesis, to MAX phases and MXenes, data-driven discovery, thermoelectrics, magnetic materials etc. There are also contributions that address characterization techniques that are particularly relevant to the synthesis of materials, notably pair distribution function methods for studying nanostructures, and in-situ and operando diffraction methods as applied to electrode materials in batteries.
