Title: Ultrasonic assisted magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide by magnetic activated carbon from aqueous samples prior to gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry analysis

Abstract: In this study, a simple ultrasonic-assisted magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction was developed for the extraction of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide from water samples before analysis with gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry. The magnetic activated carbon was synthesized and characterized by a vibrating sample magnetometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. Factors affecting the adsorption process, including the amount of adsorbent, extraction time, and pH of the sample in the extraction process, were investigated and optimized. By spreading 20 mg of adsorbent in 50 ml of water sample with pH = 6.5 for 5 min and using ethyl acetate solvent as a desorbing solvent, a good recovery (92%) of the desired analyte was obtained. The linear dynamic range was obtained in the range of 0.1–5 µg mL−1. The quantitative limit and detection limit were 0.1 µg mL−1 and 0.03 µg mL−1, respectively. The obtained results showed that the proposed preconcentration method is simple, cheap, fast, and reliable for the desired analyte.
