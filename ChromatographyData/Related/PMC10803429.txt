Title: On-column refolding and off-column assembly of parvovirus B19 virus-like particles from bacteria-expressed protein.

Abstract: Virus-like particles (VLPs) are nanometric structures composed of structural components of virions, keeping most of the cellular recognition and internalization properties, but are non-infective as they are deprived of their genetic material. VLPs have been a versatile platform for developing vaccines by carrying their own or heterologous antigenic epitopes. Moreover, VLPs can also be used as nanovessels for encapsulating molecules with therapeutic applications, like enzymes, nucleic acids, and drugs. Parvovirus B19 (B19V) VLPs can be self-assembled in vitro from the denatured major viral particle protein VP2 by equilibrium dialysis. Despite its fair productivity, this process is currently a time-consuming task. Affinity chromatography is used as an efficient step for concentration and purification, but it is only sometimes seen as a method that facilitates the oligomerization of proteins. In this research, we report a novel approach for the in vitro assembly of B19V VLPs through the immobilization of the denatured VP2 into an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column, followed by the on-column folding and the final VLP assembly upon protein elution. This method is suitable for the fast production of B19V VLPs.
