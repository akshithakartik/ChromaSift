Title: Preparation of three structurally similar stationary phases with different ionizable terminal groups and evaluation of their retention performances under multiple modes in high performance liquid chromatography

Abstract: Three structurally similar silane reagents with different terminal groups were prepared and bonded to silica to obtain three structurally similar stationary phases (Sil-Ph-COOH, Sil-Phe and Sil-Ph-NH2). The prepared stationary phases were characterized through elemental analysis (EA) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). These three stationary phases provided acceptable retention repeatability (relative standard deviations between 0.08% and 0.13%) and high column efficiency (7.3 × 104 plates/m for uridine on Sil-Phe). The retention behavior of the three columns was investigated under different chromatographic conditions including different mobile phase ratio, salt concentration, pH etc. The retention mechanisms were explored by linear solvation energy relationships and Van't Hoff plots. Applications in separation under reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and ion exchange chromatography (IEC) mode were investigated. The results showed that the retention capacity of the stationary phases with different terminal groups to the analytes is very different, especially for carboxylic acids, because the surface charges of amino groups and carboxyl groups under weakly acidic conditions produce different electrostatic effects with dissociated carboxylic acids. Finally, the Sil-Phe column was employed to detect ibuprofen extracted from pharmaceutical ibuprofen capsules and vitamins extracted from vitamin tablets.
