Title: Numerical simulation of the general rate model of chromatography using orthogonal collocation

Abstract: Process chromatography is a critical manufacturing step in the purification of biopharmaceutical therapeutics and monoclonal Antibody (mAb) capture using Protein A-chromatography is the most expensive step in the entire production chain. Protein A-chromatography performance is hard to predict due to variations in chromatography column characteristics causing wastage and reduced efficiency. Additionally, it is not yet established how to use Protein A-chromatography optimally in continuous manufacturing. Mechanistic modeling of the chromatography process enables simulation-based optimization of operations to both reduce waste and increase productivity in continuous manufacturing. We present an easy-to-use, yet computationally efficient Python package called Simulation Testbed for Liquid Chromatography (STLC). STLC is a chromatography simulator implementing a solver for the General rate model, a comprehensive mathematical model in the field, and the simplified Lumped kinetic model. STLC uses orthogonal collocation to discretize the spatial domain turning the equations into an algebraic system of ordinary differential equations. The equations are integrated in time with a fixed step length backward Euler method. We evaluate STLC in numerical trials and benchmark against high-resolution references showing high-order convergence. This allows for reduced computation system size making the package a good choice for use in the rapid prototyping of simulated chromatography processes.
