Title: Per-aqueous liquid chromatography stationary phase with poly(ethylene oxide-co-dimethylsiloxane) immobilized on mesoporous aluminized silica support

Abstract: This work proposes an alternative to searching for HPLC stationary phases to separate polar compounds. The method involves preparing an aluminized silica support and thermally immobilizing a thin layer of pre-synthesized poly(ethylene oxide-co-dimethylsiloxane) to create a chemically stable and polar stationary phase. The polymer immobilized aluminized silica-based stationary phase has a mesoporous structure (10.5 nm of mean size pore), high surface area (374 m2 g−1), and highly regular spheres. The presence of alumina (1.6% Al) ensures high chemical stability of the material under phosphate mobile phases at high pH and temperature. Using highly aqueous mobile phases and retention mechanisms of per-aqueous liquid chromatography mode, separations of polar and non-polar compounds using the proposed stationary phase are fast and efficient (N/m > 70,000 plates m−1). The aluminized silica-based stationary phase provides a viable and effective alternative to commercial reversed phases designed for polar compounds.
