Title: Investigation of the Relationship between Spontaneous Abortion, Serum Pesticides, and Polychlorinated Biphenyl Levels.

Abstract: Occupational and environmental chemical exposure have been associated with adverse reproductive consequences. This study investigates the relationship between spontaneous abortion and blood pesticide and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels. A survey was conducted, and blood samples were collected from 200 patients, consisting of 100 cases with spontaneous abortion and 100 cases with normal deliveries. A total of 150 different pesticides, including organophosphates, organochlorines, carbamates, and pyrethroids, were screened in the collected blood samples and analyzed quantitatively using Tandem mass spectrometry-specifically in combination with liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. Eight types of PCBs were analyzed with the gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The groups were compared based on these analyses. The mean age of the participants was 28.09 \xc2\xb1 4.94 years. In 59% of the spontaneous abortion group, 5.05 \xc2\xb1 1.97 chemicals were detected in different amounts. (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Analysis of the samples identified the presence of \xce\xb2-Hexachlorocyclohexane (\xce\xb2-HCH), delta-hexachlorocyclohexane (\xce\xb4 HCH), Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), Pentachlorobiphenyl-28 (PCB-28), Pentachlorobiphenyl-52 (PCB-52), o,p\'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (o,p\'-DDE), p,p\'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p\'DDE), o,p\'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (o,p\'-DDD), p,p\'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p\'-DDD), Pentachlorobiphenyl-118 (PCB-118), Pentachlorobiphenyl-101 (PCB-101), Pentachlorobiphenyl-153 (PCB-153), Pentachlorobiphenyl-138 (PCB-138), Pentachlorobiphenyl-202 (PCB-202), Pentachlorobiphenyl-180 (PCB-180) as well as Fibronil, Buprimate, Acetoclor, Acemiprid, Pentimanthalin, and Triflokystrobin. The spontaneous abortion group had significantly higher exposure to PCB-101, PCB-52, PCB-138, and \xce\xb4-HCH (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Women included in the study had high pesticide and PCB exposure rates. Many of the blood samples contained multiple pesticides with endocrine-disrupting effects. Higher exposure to organochlorine compounds in the serum was identified in the group with spontaneous abortions.
