Title: Urinary Free Cortisol Determination and Interferences Studies Using Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry after On-Line Solid Phase Extraction Based on Turboflow&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Chromatography.

Abstract: (1) A 24 h urinary free cortisol (UFF) is one of the first-line exams recommended for the diagnosis of Cushing\'s syndrome. In a hospital hormonology department, this activity can exceed several hundred dosages per week. The UFF is generally determined via an immunoassay with an automate using a chemiluminescence or electrochemiluminescence detection system. To increase the cortisol concentration in the analyzed sample, the automated analysis is preceded by urine extraction, which does not prevent there from being some interferences due to other steroids with close structures. (2) This paper describes the development of on-line solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for the analysis of urinary free cortisol. The on-line extraction was based on the Turboflow&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; chromatography coupled to the analytical column by two valves, easily available for the laboratories. (3) The choice of the Accucore Polar Premium&lt;sup&gt;\xc2\xae&lt;/sup&gt; analytical column made it possible to avoid analytical interferences with exogenous or endogenous molecules having the same SRM transition (363 \xe2\x86\x92 121) as cortisol. (4) The method was fully validated in the range of clinically relevant concentrations from the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to 411.75 nmol\xc2\xb7L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.
