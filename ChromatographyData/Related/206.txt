Title: Principles and potential of solvent gradient size-exclusion chromatography for polymer analysis

Abstract: The properties of a polymeric material are influenced by its underlying molecular distributions, including the molecular-weight (MWD), chemical-composition (CCD), and/or block-length (BLD) distributions. Gradient-elution liquid chromatography (LC) is commonly used to determine the CCD. Due to the limited solubility of polymers, samples are often dissolved in strong solvents. Upon injection of the sample, such solvents may lead to broadened or poorly shaped peaks and, in unfavourable cases, to “breakthrough” phenomena, where a part of the sample travels through the column unretained. To remedy this, a technique called size-exclusion-chromatography gradients or gradient size-exclusion chromatography (gSEC) was developed in 2011. In this work, we aim to further explore the potential of gSEC for the analysis of the CCD, also in comparison with conventional gradient-elution reversed-phase LC, which in this work corresponded to gradient-elution reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). The influence of the mobile-phase composition, the pore size of the stationary-phase particles, and the column temperature were investigated. The separation of five styrene/ethyl acrylate copolymers was studied with one-dimensional RPLC and gSEC. RPLC was shown to lead to a more-accurate CCD in shorter analysis time. The separation of five styrene/methyl methacrylate copolymers was also explored using comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) LC involving gSEC, i.e. SEC × gSEC and SEC × RPLC. In 2D-LC, the use of gSEC was especially advantageous as no breakthrough could occur.
