Title: Use and abuse of retention indices in gas chromatography

Abstract: The value of the concept of retention indices (RI) to the practice of gas chromatography (GC) is highlighted, where the RI of a compound is one component of the strategy to identify the compound. The widespread reliance on GC and then on mass spectrometry for ‘identification’, may result in inadequate confirmation of molecular identity. However, RI do provide a useful tentative indication of the possible molecule(s). Thus, the RI value is a useful first measure of the molecule identity, and shown here to be valuable provided limitations are recognised. An author has a responsibility to correctly calculate the index and then use the values for (tentative) identification. Tables of reference RI values are useful in this respect, but finding an ‘exact match’ RI value does not confirm the identity. Hence, it is necessary to understand how the RI value may be incorrectly used in this respect. The reviewer of written research is charged with ensuring the index values are applied in a rigorous manner. Selected case studies from our own work, support the care that must be exercised when reporting RI values. In terms of advanced GC operations, mention is made of multidimensional gas chromatography and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography to acquire RI values on both the first and second columns in the two-column separation experiment.
