Title: DOZNTM 2.0: A quantitative green chemistry evaluator for a sustainable future

Abstract: Merck developed and launched DOZN™2.0, a unique web-based greener alternative scoring matrix, also known as a quantitative green chemistry evaluator, based on the 12 principles of green chemistry for researcherss to evaluate relative greenness of products/processes. The 12 principles of green chemistry provide a framework for learning about green chemistry and designing or improving materials, products, processes, and systems. DOZN™2.0 scores products based on metrics for each principle and aggregates principle scores to derive a final aggregate score. The system calculates scores based on manufacturing information, Globally Harmonized System (GHS), and Safety Data Sheets (SDS) data which provide the green score for products/processes. DOZN™2.0 is flexible enough to encompass the diverse portfolio of products ranging from chemistry to biology to material science-based products. The DOZN™2.0 system has also been verified and validated by a third party to ensure best practices are applied. This new Greener Chemistry Initiative offers users an increased breadth of Greener Alternative products with confirmatory documentation to validate greener characteristics. Through DOZN™2.0 customers now have access to calculate the green scores of their processes and products. This free, web-based tool provides users with even more data so that they are properly equipped to increase their sustainability.
