Title: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of polyprenyl phosphates in Escherichia coli cells in which genes for isoprenoid synthesis are amplified

Abstract: Overproduction of isopentenyl diphosphate by the amplification of the genes for the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway, dxs and dxr, is known to be deleterious for the growth of Escherichia coli. We hypothesized that overproduction of one of the endogenous isoprenoids, in addition to isopentenyl diphosphate itself, might be the cause of the reported reduced growth rate and attempted to identify the causative agent. In order to analyze polyprenyl phosphates, they were methylated by the reaction with diazomethane. The resulting dimethyl esters of polyprenyl phosphates with carbon numbers from 40 to 60 were quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis detecting ion peaks of the sodium ion adducts. The E. coli was transformed by a multi-copy plasmid carrying both the dxs and dxr genes. Amplification of dxs and dxr significantly increased the levels of polyprenyl phosphates and 2-octaprenylphenol. The levels of Z,
                     E-mixed polyprenyl phosphates with carbon numbers of 50–60 in the strain in which ispB was co-amplified with dxs and dxr were lower than those in the control strain where only dxs and dxr were amplified. The levels of (all-E)-octaprenyl phosphate and 2-octaprenylphenol in the strains in which ispU/rth or crtE was co-amplified with dxs and dxr were lower than those in the control strain. Although the increase in the level of each isoprenoid intermediate was blocked, the growth rates of these strains were not restored. Neither polyprenyl phosphates nor 2-octaprenylphenol can be determined to be the cause of the growth rate reduction seen with dxs and dxr amplification.
