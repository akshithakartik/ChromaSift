Title: Hybrid grafted and hyperbranched anion exchangers for ion chromatography

Abstract: Novel grafted anion exchangers with covalently bonded hyperbranched functional layers were prepared and evaluated for the separation of monovalent standard inorganic anions and oxyhalides. Preparation of base coating included grafting highly polar N-vinylformamide to the ethylvinylbenzene-divinylbenzene (EVB-DVB) substrate surface in highly polar solvent (methanol) with subsequent hydrolysis of grafted amide polymer in basic media, which resulted in preparation of polymer chains with multiple primary amino groups. Those amino groups were used as attachment points for forming hyperbranched anion-exchange layers using 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether and primary mono- or diamine (methylamine or 1,3-diaminopropane, respectively). The effects of hyperbranching reaction cycles number on selectivity were evaluated which revealed that selectivity and capacity can be controlled independently for the covalently bonded stationary phases in contrast to electrostatically bonded phases. It was demonstrated that unlike for electrostatically bonded phases, the intentional increase of crosslink by using primary diamine instead of primary monoamine doesn't cause the shift of selectivity coefficients. It was also shown that crosslink distribution throughout the hyperbranched layer is an important factor determining selectivity of hyperbranched anion exchangers.
