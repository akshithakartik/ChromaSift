Title: An N terminomics toolbox combining 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde probes and click chemistry for profiling protease specificity

Abstract: Proteomic profiling of protease-generated N termini provides key insights into protease function and specificity. However, current technologies have sequence limitations or require specialized synthetic reagents for N-terminal peptide isolation. Here, we introduce an N terminomics toolbox that combines selective N-terminal biotinylation using 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2PCA) reagents with chemically cleavable linkers to enable efficient enrichment of protein N termini. By incorporating a commercially available alkyne-modified 2PCA in combination with Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), our strategy eliminates the need for chemical synthesis of N-terminal probes. Using these reagents, we developed PICS2 (Proteomic Identification of Cleavage Sites with 2PCA) to profile the specificity of subtilisin/kexin-type proprotein convertases (PCSKs). We also implemented CHOPPER (chemical enrichment of protease substrates with purchasable, elutable reagents) for global sequencing of apoptotic proteolytic cleavage sites. Based on their broad applicability and ease of implementation, PICS2 and CHOPPER are useful tools that will advance our understanding of protease biology.
