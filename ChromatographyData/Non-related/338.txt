Title: 4.11 The chemistry of quantum materials

Abstract: Quantum materials have emerged as an exciting interface between materials chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics. A quantum material is one in which the structure, behavior, or reactivity arise from quantum mechanical interactions that are not adequately captured by classical models and calculations. The chapter gives a brief history of the field and sets the context for understanding recent advances by giving two different classification schemes by which to organize different quantum materials and phenomena. Drawing on exemplars of the behavior, the connections between chemistry and quantum materials is discussed and explored. Real compounds and real materials are then discussed in the context of these classifications, and limitations of existing approaches evaluated. The frontiers of the field – covering synthesis, characterization, and theory – and involving convergences with data science and quantum information science and engineering are proposed. The scalable atomic control of synthesis is identified as a particular urgent need, and will be enabled by the development of a comprehensive understanding of solid state reactivity in the vein of retrosynthetic analysis familiar to most molecular chemists. The content of the chapter is particularly targeted at chemists of all education levels interested in joining the worldwide efforts in quantum materials to further fundamental knowledge and society.
