Title: Potential of the Novel Slot Blot Method with a PVDF Membrane for Protein Identification and Quantification in Kampo Medicines.

Abstract: Kampo is a Japanese traditional medicine modified from traditional Chinese medicine. Kampo medicines contain various traditional crude drugs with unknown compositions due to the presence of low-molecular-weight compounds and proteins. However, the proteins are generally rare and extracted with high-polarity solvents such as water, making their identification and quantification difficult. To develop methods for identifying and quantifying the proteins in Kampo medicines, in the current study we employ previous technology (e.g., column chromatography, electrophoresis, and membrane chromatography), focusing on membrane chromatography with a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Moreover, we consider slot blot analysis based on the principle of membrane chromatography, which is beneficial for analyzing the proteins in Kampo medicines as the volume of the samples is not limited. In this article, we assess a novel slot blot method developed in 2017 and using a PVDF membrane and special lysis buffer to quantify advanced glycation end products-modified proteins against other slot blots. We consider our slot blot analysis superior for identifying and quantifying proteins in Kampo medicines compared with other methods as the data obtained with our novel slot blot can be shown with both error bars and the statistically significant difference, and our operation step is simpler than those of other methods.
