Title: New and Rapid Analytical Method Using HPLC-MS Detection for Acrylamide Determination in Black Ripe Olives.

Abstract: The presence of acrylamide, a known human carcinogen, in various heated foods raises significant concerns among consumers. Therefore, the development of a good analytical method is of paramount interest to the scientific community. Keeping this in view, a rapid, simple, reliable, and low-cost analytical method was developed and validated for acrylamide quantification in black ripe olives. The method consisted of the water extraction of the compounds from crushed olives with the addition of (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)acrylamide as an internal standard. The quantification was performed using high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass detection with positive electrospray ionization. The limits of detection and quantification were determined to be 4 and 11 \xc2\xb5g/kg, respectively. The developed method exhibited excellent results in terms of accuracy (98.4-104.8%) and intra- and inter-day precision limits, both less than 20%. This new method was carried out by analyzing 15 samples of Spanish commercial black ripe olives, revealing a wide range of values, from 79 to 1068 \xc2\xb5g/kg of fruit. The new protocol reduces the analysis time to just one hour per sample versus the minimum 24 h required by gas chromatography and mass detection, meaning that it could be a good option for the routine analysis of acrylamide in black ripe olives, and may be extendable to the analysis of this compound in other foods.
