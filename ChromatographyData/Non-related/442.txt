Title: Towards the development of biostable dental resin systems - design criteria and constraints beyond ester-free chemistries

Abstract: Objective
                  The objective of this review article is to summarize the current literature on dental resin-based restorative (RBR) materials specifically from the perspective of emerging resin technologies, and to provide researchers with structured design criteria enabling the effective screening of new RBR developments.
               
                  Methods
                  The continued failure of newly introduced RBRs to address biostability without compromising function, over the last decade, are presented as a rationale to support different resin-based concepts. Several developments in the field, aimed at addressing the issues facing modern resin-based systems are summarized and their limitations discussed. A design workflow is proposed for evaluating new RBR, considering resource needs.
               
                  Results
                  While several alternative resin chemistries have been suggested over the past decade, all have shown serious limitations in replacing MA-based materials, including their limited physical and mechanical properties, and curing kinetics. Additionally, a broad and inconsistent range of laboratory methods have been used to validate these developments, leading to results that are difficult to compare across studies. A design workflow was conceptualized to facilitate the screening of novel RBRs from both a clinical and research perspective.
               
                  Significance
                  While several alternative chemistries have shown some degree of potential in emulating material property aspects of MA-based resins, a complete restorative system that is resistant to biochemical reactions in saliva has yet to achieve broad clinical adoption. To further spur development, it would be useful to have a more systematic design workflow, that may be used to easily screen new resin technologies effectively early in the design phase, so as to mitigate potential performance failures in the clinic.
