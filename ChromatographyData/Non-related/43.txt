Title: C1 Chemistry: The Stories of Research and Applications from Toyama

Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the distinguished academic career and scientific accomplishments of Prof. Noritatsu Tsubaki at the University of Toyama. For over 35 years, he has dedicated himself to the research field of one-carbon (C1) chemistry, including catalytic conversion of C1 molecules to valuable chemicals and superclean fuels, innovative catalyst and reactor development, and the design of new catalytic reactions and processes. Organized chronologically, this review highlights Prof. Tsubaki's academic contributions from 1990, when he studied and worked at The University of Tokyo, to his current role as a full professor at the University of Toyama. The academic section of this review is divided into three main parts, focusing on Prof. Tsubaki's pioneering work in C1 chemistry. We believe that this review will serve as a highly valuable reference for colleagues in the fields of C1 chemistry and catalysis, and inspire the development of more original and groundbreaking research.
