Title: Soil chemistry and climate change

Abstract: Greenhouse gases (GHGs) alter the Earth's climate by absorbing energy in the lower atmosphere and re-emitting it. Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) contribute most to global warming. Soil is a major source and sink of GHGs. Here, the impact of soil chemistry, including soil organic matter, pH and nutrients on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions and the feedbacks of climate change, including warming, drying, precipitation and wildfires on soil chemistry are discussed.
