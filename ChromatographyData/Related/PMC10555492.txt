Title: Establishment and Performance Evaluation of Multiplex PCR-Dipstick DNA Chromatography for &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; Rapid Detection.

Abstract: &lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Nasopharyngeal swab samples of 300 children with an acute respiratory tract infection were detected by a multiplex PCR-dipstick chromatography assay, and the results were compared with the DNA sequencing and serum IgM antibody assay.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A multiplex PCR-dipstick DNA assay can specifically detect &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and shows a good specificity, with a minimum detection limit of 10\xe2\x80\x89CFU/mL, respectively. Using DNA sequencing results as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the multiplex PCR-dipstick DNA chromatography assay for the diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; were 96.61%, 100%, 100%, and 99.18% respectively, and those of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; were 95.24%, 100%, 100%, and 99.64% respectively. There was no statistical significance MP and CP diagnosis by the multiplex PCR-dipstick DNA assay and DNA sequencing (MP: &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5; CP: &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.0), and the two assays had very high statistical consistency (MP: kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.979; CP: kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.974). The positive rate of the multiplex PCR-dipstick chromatography assay was significantly higher than that of the serum IgM antibody assay, with MP (17.7% vs. 13.3%), CP (5.7% vs. 3.3%), and mixed infection of MP and CP (1.3% vs. 0.67%).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;A multiplex PCR-dipstick chromatography assay was successfully established for the joint detection of &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; within 2\xe2\x80\x89hours. It is simple, fast, sensitive, accurate, cost-effective with good diagnostic performance, which can be used for small laboratories and point-of-care diagnosis.
