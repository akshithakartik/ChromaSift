Title: Control mechanisms of water chemistry based on long-term analyses of the Yangtze River

Abstract: Long-term series data can provide a glimpse of the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on water chemistry. However, few studies have been conducted to analyze the driving forces of the chemistry of large rivers based on long-term data. This study aimed to analyze the variations and driving mechanisms of riverine chemistry from 1999 to 2019. We compiled published data on major ions in the Yangtze River, one of the three largest rivers in the world. The results showed that Na+ and Cl− concentrations decreased with increasing discharge. Significant differences in riverine chemistry were found between the upper and middle-lower reaches. Major ion concentrations in the upper reaches were mainly controlled by evaporites, especially Na+ and Cl− ions. In contrast, major ion concentrations in the middle-lower reaches were mainly affected by silicate and carbonate weathering. Furthermore, human activities were the drivers of some major ions, notably SO4
                     2− ions associated with coal emissions. The increased major ions and total dissolved solids in the Yangtze River in the last 20 years were ascribed to the continuous acidification of the river and the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. Attention should be given to the impact of anthropogenic activities on the water quality of the Yangtze River.
