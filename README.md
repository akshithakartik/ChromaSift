<h1 align="center">ChromaSift ðŸ§ª</h1>


## â€¢ Description

ChromaSift is a **specialized search engine** designed to filter and rank **chromatography-related documents** from a large corpus of scientific abstracts. Users can **query specific keywords** to retrieve documents, which are then ranked by relevance and assigned a **similarity score**. Additionally, ChromaSift allows users to access the full content of resulting documents by clicking on their titles, providing direct links to the corresponding scientific journals.

Scientific journals like PubMed are first scraped to obtain a corpus of abstracts. These are then pre-processed, using methods like stopword removal and lemmatization, and inputted to the Neo4j graph database and ML model. The ML phase of the pipeline consists of SciBERT - a domain-specific adaptation of BERT tailored specifically for scientific text - which is utilized to obtain document and query embeddings. Metrics like Cosine Similarity and BM-25 are combined to form a hybrid score, reflecting the percentage similarity of a document to the query. Finally, this is integrated with Streamlit to create an interactive interface for users.
