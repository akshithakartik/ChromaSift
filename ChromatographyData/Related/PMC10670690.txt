Title: A Comparative Evaluation of HbA1c Measurement Methods and Their Implications for Diabetes Management.

Abstract: In this study, we assessed the correlations between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurements obtained using three different diagnostic methods, namely reversed-phase cation-exchange chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and lateral flow immunoassay (LIFA) with an AnyLab F instrument. HbA1c levels measured with the AnyLab F instrument and those measured with the HA8190V, HA8180, and D100 instruments were strongly correlated. High R-square values and low &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values indicated significant and reliable correlations, supporting the clinical interchangeability of these methods. Notably, demographic and clinical analyses revealed uniform HbA1c levels across age groups, suggesting minimal age-related variations in HbA1c levels in the cohort. This finding has implications for diabetes management strategies across different age groups, emphasizing the versatility of the AnyLab F instrument. Overall an average HbA1c level of 7.857% among diabetes mellitus-diagnosed participants suggests moderately elevated HbA1c levels, underscoring the need for improved diabetes management. Younger individuals exhibited lower HbA1c levels, potentially owing to heightened awareness and treatment plan adherence. Conversely, older adults had higher HbA1c levels, likely influenced by age-related changes and comorbidities. Larger sample sizes and a comprehensive evaluation of various measurement principles are needed to strengthen the findings herein. Additionally, exploring additional biomarkers and assessing LIFA performance in larger sample sets will advance the clinical utility of HbA1c measurements.
