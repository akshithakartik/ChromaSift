Title: Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography Coupled with Mass Spectrometry in Parallel with High-Throughput Venomics and Bioassaying for Venom Profiling.

Abstract: Modern analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is a suitable technique to separate venom toxin families according to their size characteristics. In this study, a method was developed to separate intact venom toxins from &lt;i&gt;Bungarus multicinctus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Daboia russelii&lt;/i&gt; venoms via analytical SEC using volatile, non-salt-containing eluents for post-column mass spectrometry, coagulation bioassaying and high-throughput venomics. Two venoms were used to demonstrate the method developed. While the venom of &lt;i&gt;Bungaurs multicinctus&lt;/i&gt; is known to exert anticoagulant effects on plasma, in this study, we showed the existence of both procoagulant toxins and anticoagulant toxins. For &lt;i&gt;Daboia russelii&lt;/i&gt; venom, the method revealed characteristic procoagulant effects, with a 90 kDa mass toxin detected and matched with the Factor X-activating procoagulant heterotrimeric glycoprotein named RVV-X. The strong procoagulant effects for this toxin show that it was most likely eluted from size exclusion chromatography non-denatured. In conclusion, the separation of snake venom by size gave the opportunity to separate some specific toxin families from each other non-denatured, test these for functional bioactivities, detect the eluting mass on-line via mass spectrometry and identify the eluted toxins using high-throughput venomics.
