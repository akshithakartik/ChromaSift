Title: The Natural &lt;i&gt;Ficus carica&lt;/i&gt; L. (fig) Extract as an Effective Prophylactic Antibacterial Agent for Inflammation-Related Infections.

Abstract: &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;) is a multidrug-resistance Gram-negative organism responsible for carbapenem-resistant infections. These challenges have inspired studies on the use of natural products as alternatives to conventional drugs. The aim of this study was to analyze the antibacterial and antioxidant effects of &lt;i&gt;Ficus carica&lt;/i&gt; L. (fig) branch extracts and to perform in vivo animal experiments to better understand the absorption mechanisms of the antibacterial components during the digestion process after oral administration. The antibacterial components of the fig branch extracts were analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). An in vivo animal study and liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QQQ-MS/MS) analyses were performed to analyze the deacetylation reactions of the fig extracts after oral administration in mice. Ultimately, the antibacterial effects of the fig extracts increased with the fractional distillation time. The fig extracts showed excellent antibacterial effects against &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;). The three antibacterial and antioxidant components of the fig extracts were revealed to be eugenol, acetyleugenol, and psoralen. Interestingly, in this study, we identified acetyleugenol in the phenolic compounds of the fig extract for the first time. Through in vivo animal testing, we observed the deacetylation reaction of acetyleugenol to eugenol in the fig extract as digestion proceeded in the internal organs of the mice after oral administration. The results of this study suggest the use of natural fig extract as an effective therapeutic and prophylactic antibacterial agent for inflammation-related infections with a wide variety of biomedical applications.
