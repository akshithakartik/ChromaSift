Title: Why is it important to understand the nature and chemistry of tannins to exploit their potential as nutraceuticals?

Abstract: Tannins comprise a large group of polyphenols that can differ widely in chemical composition and molecular weight. The use of tannins dates back to antiquity, but it is only in recent years that their potential use as nutraceuticals associated with the human diet is beginning to be exploited. Although the biological effects of these phytocomplexes have been studied for many years, there are still several open questions regarding their chemistry and biotransformation. The vastness of the molecules that make up the class of tannins has made their characterisation, as well as their nomenclature and classification, a daunting task.
                  This review has been written with the aim of bringing order to the chemistry of tannins by including aspects that are sometimes still overlooked or should be updated with new research in order to understand the potential of these phytocomplexes as active ingredients or technological components for nutraceutical products. Future trends in tannin research should address many questions that are still open, such as determining the exact biosynthetic pathways of all classes of tannins, the actual biological effects determined by the interaction of tannins with other molecules, their metabolization, and the best extraction methods, but with a view to market requirements.
