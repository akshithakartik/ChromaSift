Title: Teaching greener & more sustainable analytical chemistry to undergraduates: Some strategies & tips

Abstract: This Perspectives article describes some current resources to support the teaching of Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) at higher education institutions. The resources span from introductory to upper-level courses, and from classroom to laboratory environments. Strategies are discussed to assist analytical chemistry instructors in adopting best practices from other sub-disciplines to weave the Twelve GAC Principles throughout their curricula. These approaches vary from modification of entrenched instructor expectations and requirements to connections with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and from inclusion of expository laboratory activities to inquiry-based and research-focused ones.
