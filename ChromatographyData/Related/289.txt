Title: Enzyme activity- and chemometrics-assisted comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry for the analysis of honeysuckle

Abstract: A unique and effective comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography system was established and applied for the analysis of bioactive components in honeysuckle. Under the optimal conditions, Eclipse Plus C18 (2.1 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm, Agilent) and SB-C18 (4.6 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm, Agilent) columns were chosen for the first dimension (1D) and the second dimension (2D) separation. The optimal flow rates of 1D and 2D were 0.12 mL/min and 2.0 mL/min, respectively. Additionally, the proportion of organic solution was optimized to enhance orthogonality and integrated shift, and full gradient elution mode was adopted to improve chromatographic resolution. Furthermore, a total of 57 compounds were identified by molecular weight, retention time and collision cross-section value obtained from ion mobility mass spectrometry. Based on the data obtained from the principal component analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis, the categories of honeysuckle in different regions were significantly different. Moreover, the half maximal inhibitory concentration values of most samples were between 0.37 and 1.55 mg/mL, and most samples were potent α-glucosidase inhibitors, which is better for the evaluation of the quality of drugs from two aspects of substance content and activity.
