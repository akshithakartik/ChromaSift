Title: Case hacks in action: Examples from a case study on green chemistry in education for sustainable development

Abstract: This paper aims to outline an approach for case-based chemistry and chemical engineering education for sustainability. Education for Sustainability is assumed to offer a holistic approach to equip students with the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes needed to contribute to a more sustainable society in their future careers. While Case-Based Education traditionally focuses on disciplinary learning in simulated settings, it can also effectively teach essential sustainability-related skills like integrated problem-solving, critical thinking, and systems thinking. The approach we propose is “case hacking”, which should be understood as utilizing existing business cases while incorporating supplementary resources to align the assignment with intended learning objectives. This expansion of the cases involves, among other things, introducing additional questions and assignments, perspectives from stakeholders previously unexplored in the original case, and the integration of recent research articles from relevant fields. We advocate for the use of case hacking when educators want to harness the educational benefits of Case-Based Education while emphasizing the complexity of sustainability-related challenges faced by industrial companies today. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate the process of hacking a case related to Green Chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, highlighting specific challenges for chemistry and chemical engineering education. We hope this example will inspire educators in these disciplinary contexts to engage with the case hacking approach as they navigate the complex terrain of sustainability.
