Title: Ni(II) functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane based capillary monolith for purification of histidine-tagged proteins by immobilized metal affinity micro-chromatography

Abstract: A new capillary monolithic stationary phase was synthesized for the purification of histidine tagged proteins by immobilized metal affinity micro-chromatography (μ-IMAC). For this purpose, mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) linked-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane [MSA@poly(POSS-MA)] monolith 300 μm in diameter was obtained by thiol-methacrylate polymerization using methacryl substituted-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS-MA) and MSA as the thiol functionalized agent in a fused silica capillary tubing. Ni(II) cations were immobilized onto the porous monolith via metal-chelate complex formation with double carboxyl functionality of bound MSA segments. μ-IMAC separations aiming the purification of histidine tagged-green fluorescent protein (His-GFP) from Escherichia coli extract were carried out on Ni(II)@MSA functionalized-poly(POSS-MA) [Ni(II)@MSA@poly(POSS-MA)] capillary monolith. His-GFP was succesfully isolated by μ-IMAC on Ni(II)@MSA@poly(POSS-MA) capillary monolith with the isolation yield of 85 % and the purity of 92 % from E. coli extract. Higher His-GFP isolation yields were obtained with lower His-GFP feed concentrations and lower feed flow rates. The monolith was used for consecutive His-GFP purifications with a tolerable decrease in equilibrium His-GFP adsorption over five runs.
