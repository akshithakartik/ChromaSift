Title: Exploring Antioxidant and \xce\xb1-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities in Mulberry Leaves (&lt;i&gt;Morus alba&lt;/i&gt; L.) across Growth Stages: A Comprehensive Metabolomic Analysis with Chemometrics.

Abstract: Metabolic product accumulation exhibited variations among mulberry (&lt;i&gt;Morus alba&lt;/i&gt; L.) leaves (MLs) at distinct growth stages, and this assessment was conducted using a combination of analytical techniques including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Multivariate analysis was applied to the data, and the findings were correlated with antioxidant activity and \xce\xb1-glucosidase inhibitory effects in vitro. Statistical analyses divided the 27 batches of MLs at different growth stages into three distinct groups. In vitro assays for antioxidant activity and \xce\xb1-glucosidase inhibition revealed that IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were highest at the Y23 stage, which corresponds to the \'Frost Descends\' solar term. In summary, the results of this study indicate that MLs at different growth stages throughout the year can be categorized into three primary growth stages using traditional Chinese solar terms as reference points, based on the observed variations in metabolite content.
