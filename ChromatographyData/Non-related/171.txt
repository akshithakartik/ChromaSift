Title: Hematology and serum chemistry of female South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) from Isla de Lobos , Uruguay

Abstract: Hematology and serum chemistry are used to diagnose disease in marine mammals in captivity and in the wild. Clinicopathologic variables are the first step in determining treatment and assessing the suitability for rehabilitation and release. The South American fur seal (SAFS; Arctocephalus australis) occurs along the Pacific coast from southern Peru to Cape Horn and northward to southern Brazil on the Atlantic coast. The goal of this study was to evaluate hematologic, clinical chemistry, and physical parameters of eight female SAFS from coastal Uruguay. Segmented neutrophils were the major leukocytes followed by lymphocytes. The mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was similar to that reported previously for females and pups, except two females that showed higher levels. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in SAFS from our study was markedly higher than values reported for Chilean SAFS. AST and ALT values found could be related to liver damage. ALP levels in the females were within the range reported previously. Creatinine was higher compared with females and pups from Chile. The differences found in hematology and serum chemistry between Chilean and Uruguayan populations may also be related to differences in physiological and immune status. Basophils, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, lymphocyte plasma cells, and immature or pathologic forms were not observed. No unusual values were observed for red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets. Glucose, uricemia, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Na, Cl, Ca, P and K levels are the first report for the species. These are the first results on the hemotology and blood chemistry of otherwise wild SAFS from Isla de Lobos, which can be used to assess the health of wild populations and during rehabilitation.
