Title: Inclusion of Porous Graphitic Carbon Chromatography Yields Greater Protein Identification and Compartment and Process Coverage and Enables More Reflective Protein-Level Label-Free Quantitation.

Abstract: The ubiquity of mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomic analyses as a component of biological investigation mandates the validation of methodologies that increase acquisition efficiency, improve sample coverage, and enhance profiling depth. Chromatographic separation is often ignored as an area of potential improvement, with most analyses relying on traditional reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC); this consistent reliance on a single chromatographic paradigm fundamentally limits our view of the observable proteome. Herein, we build upon early reports and validate porous graphitic carbon chromatography (PGC) as a facile means to substantially enhance proteomic coverage without changes to sample preparation, instrument configuration, or acquisition methods. Analysis of offline fractionated cell line digests using both separations revealed an increase in peptide and protein identifications by 43% and 24%, respectively. Increased identifications provided more comprehensive coverage of cellular components and biological processes independent of protein abundance, highlighting the substantial quantity of proteomic information that may go undetected in standard analyses. We further utilize these data to reveal that label-free quantitative analyses using RPLC separations alone may not be reflective of actual protein constituency. Together, these data highlight the value and comprehension offered through PGC-MS proteomic analyses.
