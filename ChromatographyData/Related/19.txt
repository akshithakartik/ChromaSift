Title: Resin and loading condition screening for effective and robust byproducts removal by anion exchange chromatography: A case study

Abstract: In downstream processing of protein therapeutics, ion exchange (IEX) chromatography is a powerful tool for removing byproducts whose isoelectric point (pI) is appreciably different from that of the product. Although in theory for a given case cation exchange (CEX) and anion exchange (AEX) chromatography should be equally effective for separation, in reality they may show different effectiveness. In the current work, with a case study, we demonstrated that AEX is more effective than CEX chromatography at removing the associated byproducts. In addition, we screened AEX resins and loading conditions to achieve best separation. Finally, we demonstrated that effective separation was achieved with the selected resin/condition, and chromatography performance was comparable between runs conducted at low and high load densities, suggesting that the developed process was relatively robust. The procedure described in this work can be used as a general approach for selecting resin and loading condition that allow for effective and robust removal of byproduct that binds weaker than the product to the selected type of column.
