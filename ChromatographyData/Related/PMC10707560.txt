Title: Optimization of Xylooligosaccharides Production by Native and Recombinant Xylanase Hydrolysis of Chicken Feed Substrates.

Abstract: Poultry production faces several challenges, with feed efficiency being the main factor that can be influenced through the use of different nutritional strategies. Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are functional feed additives that are attracting growing commercial interest due to their excellent ability to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. The aim of the study was to apply crude and purified fungal xylanases, from &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma harzianum,&lt;/i&gt; as well as a recombinant glycoside hydrolase family 10 xylanase, derived from &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&lt;/i&gt; T6, as additives to locally produced chicken feeds. A Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was used to optimize the reducing sugar yield. Response surface methodology (RSM) revealed that reducing sugars were higher (8.05 mg/mL, 2.81 mg/mL and 2.98 mg/mL) for the starter feed treated with each of the three enzymes compared to the treatment with grower feed (3.11 mg/mL, 2.41 mg/mL and 2.62 mg/mL). The hydrolysis products were analysed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and showed that the enzymes hydrolysed the chicken feeds, producing a range of monosaccharides (arabinose, mannose, glucose, and galactose) and XOS, with xylobiose being the predominant XOS. These results show promising data for future applications as additives to poultry feeds.
