Title: A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for plasma glucagon

Abstract: Glucagon is a peptide involved in controlling the body's blood glucose levels. The majority of analytical methods used for its quantitation are based on immunoassays that suffer from cross-reactivity with other peptides. For accurate routine analysis a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS) was developed. Glucagon was extracted from plasma samples by a combination of protein precipitation using ethanol and mixed anion exchange solid phase extraction. Linearity for glucagon was above 0.99 (r2) up to a concentration range of 771 ng/L with a lower limit of quantification established at 19 ng/L. Precision of the method was below 9% (coefficient of variation). Recovery was 93%. Correlations with the existing immunoassay displayed a significant negative bias.
