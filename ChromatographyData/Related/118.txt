Title: Sensitive analysis of 18 aminoglycosides in bovine milk using hydrophilic interaction chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry

Abstract: A sensitive and selective method was developed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry to detect 18 aminoglycosides in bovine milk. Aminoglycosides were extracted from milk using a mixture of trichloroacetic acid, ammonium acetate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and sodium chloride, and then isolated using an Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction cartridge. We evaluated the performance of chromatographic columns with different stationary phases and optimized the mobile phases to achieve satisfactory separation of the analytes. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.05–2 µg/kg and 0.1–5 µg/kg, respectively. The recoveries of the method ranged from 78.9% to 101.1%, with intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations of less than 8.1% and 9.0%, respectively. This method was applied to 30 milk samples collected from markets, and neomycin (16.8 µg/kg) was detected in one fresh bovine milk sample. The proposed method provides a powerful tool for the surveillance of aminoglycosides in bovine milk.
