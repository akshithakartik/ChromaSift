Title: Derivatization-Enhanced Analysis of Glucocorticoids for Structural Characterization by Gas Chromatography-Orbitrap High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry.

Abstract: Glucocorticoids are classified in section S9 of the Prohibited List of the World Anti-Doping Agency, due to a potential risk to improving physical performance and causing harm to the health of athletes. Based on the similar physiological actions of glucocorticoids, both differentiating known glucocorticoids and identifying unknown glucocorticoids are important for doping control. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry plays an important role in structural characterization because of abundant structural diagnostic ions produced by electron ionization. It also provides a chance to study the fragmentation patterns. Thus, an enhanced derivatization procedure was optimized to produce trimethylsilylated glucocorticoids and structural diagnostic ions of nineteen trimethylsilylated glucocorticoids were obtained by gas chromatography-orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry. In our study, glucocorticoids were classified as: 3-keto-4-ene, 1,4-diene-3-keto, 3\xce\xb1-hydroxy with saturated A-ring, 21-hydroxy-20-keto and halo substituent glucocorticoids based on their structural difference. Structural diagnostic ions that contributed to structural characterization were specifically presented and the fragment patterns were demonstrated according to the above categories. This study not only gave new insights into the structural characterization of these glucocorticoids but also provided evidence for tracing unknown glucocorticoids or chemically modified molecules.
