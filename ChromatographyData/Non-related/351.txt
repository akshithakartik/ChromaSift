Title: Insights into the surface chemistry induced photoreactivity of Fe-doped SnO2 in dye degradation

Abstract: Nanostructured SnO2 emerged as an excellent photocatalytic material for wastewater treatment, but the limitation appears due to its high optical bandgap. Transition metal doping and composite are the common strategies to drag down its bandgap from UV to the visible region. In this manuscript, we highlight the surface defects induced photoreactivity of Fe-doped SnO2 in dye degradation. The native surface defects and the charge carrier concentrations have been found to diminish with the Fe incorporation in SnO2. The doping-induced surface hydroxyl groups are found to increase the charge transfer resistance. In subsequent, the combined effects of all decline the photoreactivity of Fe-doped SnO2. In light of the above, we demonstrate for the first time the pivotal role of native surface defects and surface chemistry in the photocatalysis process. This demonstration holds promise for other nanostructures where defects play a significant role.
