Title: Recent progress in the analysis of unsaturated fatty acids in biological samples by chemical derivatization-based chromatography-mass spectrometry methods

Abstract: Unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) are essential fatty acids that execute various biological functions in the human body. Therefore, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of UFAs in biological samples can help to clarify their roles in the occurrence and development of diseases, so to reveal the mechanisms of pathogenesis and potential drug intervention strategies. Chromatography-mass spectrometry is one of the most commonly used techniques for the analysis of UFAs in biological samples. However, due to factors such as the complex structural information of UFAs (the number and specific location of CC double bonds) and the low concentration of UFAs in biological samples, it is still difficult to conduct accurate qualitative and/or quantitative studies of UFAs in complex biological samples. In recent years, the integration and application of chemical derivatization and chromatography-mass spectrometry has been widely used in the detection of UFAs. Based on this overview, we reviewed recent developments and application progress for chemical derivatization-based chromatography-mass spectrometry methods for the qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of UFAs in biological samples over the past ten years. Potential trends for the design and improvement of novel derivatization reagents were proposed.
