Title: Discussion on the Differences in Aroma Components in Different Fragrant Rice Varieties during Storage.

Abstract: Rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an important food crop in Taiwan, among which fragrant rice is highly regarded for its special aroma when cooked. During the storage of fragrant rice, the aroma components will change, which will affect the aroma quality of fragrant rice. Therefore, headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) was used in this study, combined with gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, to analyze the difference in the aroma components of Taikeng No. 4 (TK4), Tainung No. 71 (TN71), Kaohsiung No. 147 (KH147), and Taichung No. 194 (TC194) fragrant rice. A total of 28 aroma components were identified in the four varieties of fragrant rice, and the main components were all Nonanal. Among them, TK4 contains a very high content of hydrocarbons, including Tridecane and Dodecane; TN71, KH147, and TC194 contain mainly aldehydes such as Nonanal and Hexanal. During different storage times, the contents of alcohols, monoterpenes, aromatic aldehydes, and furans increased with storage time, while the content of aliphatic aldehydes decreased with storage time. After storage, the fragrant rice samples showed a tendency for the total volatile component content to decrease, with the most pronounced reduction observed in Nonanal content.
