Title: Sustainable chemistry

Abstract: More than two decades have passed since the Green Chemistry 12 principles were fixed by Anastas and Warner (1998), since then there has been an evolution to another pathway, “Sustainable Chemistry”, which includes Green Chemistry. There has been a significant transformation, and green and sustainable chemistry has become a great field that it is impossible to embrace in this Encyclopedia. However, providing some examples and guidelines on the main areas of work could contribute to building new pathways to Sustainable Products and Processes. Driven by the necessity for action on climate and other concerns, science and engineering are requested to create more sustainable chemicals, materials and processes. From lab to market, they are asked to be safer, too. Therefore, it is essential to dedicate a part to some enabling systems, complementary technologies (digitalization) and tools that attach Sustainable Chemistry in its pathway to a sustainable planet.
