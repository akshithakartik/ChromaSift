Title: Protocol for differential multi-omic analyses of distinct cell types in the mouse cerebral cortex.

Abstract: Here, we present a protocol for differential multi-omic analyses of distinct cell types in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We describe steps for in utero electroporation, subsequent flow-cytometry-based isolation of developing mouse cortical cells, bulk RNA sequencing or quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analyses. This protocol can be applied to compare the proteomes and transcriptomes of developing mouse cortical cell populations after various manipulations (e.g., epigenetic). For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Meka et\xc2\xa0al. (2022).&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
