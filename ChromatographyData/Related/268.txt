Title: Coupling of chromatography and precipitation for adjusting acidic variant content in a monoclonal antibody pool

Abstract: The acidic charge variants (av) of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are often reported to have reduced therapeutic potency compared with the main (mv) and basic variants (bv), therefore reduction in the av content in mAb pools is often prioritized over reduction in the bv content.
                  In previous studies we described two different methods for reducing the av content, which were based on either ion exchange chromatography or selective precipitation in polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions. In this study, we have developed a coupled process, in which advantages of simplicity and ease in realization of PEG-aided precipitation and high separation selectivity of anion exchange chromatography (AEX) were exploited. The design of AEX was supported by the kinetic-dispersive model, which was supplemented with the colloidal particle adsorption isotherm, whereas the precipitation process and its coupling with AEX was quantified by simple mass balance equations and underlying thermodynamic dependencies. The model was used to assess the performance of the coupling of AEX and precipitation under different operating conditions. The advantage of the coupled process over the stand-alone AEX depended on the demand for the av reduction as well as the initial variant composition of the mAb pool, e.g., the improvement in the throughput provided by the optimized sequence of AEX and PREC varied from 70 to 600% for the initial av content changed from 35 to 50% w/w, and the reduction demand changed from 30 to 60%.
