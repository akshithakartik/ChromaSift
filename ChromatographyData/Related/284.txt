Title: Development and validation of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay to quantify plasma 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol: A new approach integrating the concept of ion ratio

Abstract: Accurate quantification of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol holds substantial biological significance due to their involvement in pivotal cellular processes, encompassing cholesterol homeostasis, inflammatory responses, neuronal signaling, and their potential as disease biomarkers. The plasma determination of these oxysterols is challenging considering their low concentrations and similarities in terms of empirical formulae, molecular structure, and physicochemical properties across all human endogenous plasma oxysterols. To overcome these sensitivity and specificity issues, we developed and validated a quantification method using liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometry instrument. Validation studies were designed inspired by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) C62-A Guidelines. The linearity ranged between 20 and 300 nM for both oxysterols with limits of quantification at 20 nM and 30 nM for 24(S)-OHC and 27-OHC, respectively. Inter-day precision coefficient variations (CV) were lower than 10% for both oxysterols. An optimal separation of 25-OHC was obtained from 24(S)-OHC and 27-OHC with a resolution (Rs) > 1.25. The determination and validation of ion ratios for 24(S)-OHC and 27-OHC enabled another quality check in identifying interferents that could impact the quantification. Our developed and validated LC-MS/MS method allows consistent and reliable quantification of human plasmatic 24(S)-OHC and 27-OHC that is warranted in fundamental and clinical research projects.
