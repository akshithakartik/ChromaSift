Title: Segmented two-dimensional liquid chromatography. Proof of concept study

Abstract: The separation in liquid chromatography is defined either by the space domain where it proceeds until the least retained analyte reaches the outlet of the column or by the time when individual analytes elute out of the column. These two approaches lead to the four possible combinations of two-dimensional liquid chromatography with online space x time coupling being the least experimentally feasible. Here, we show the development of a novel two-dimensional liquid chromatography method combining separation defined by space and the conventional elution-based separation. First-dimension column consisted of four capillary segments coupled serially via two-position six-port valves allowing an online and comprehensive transfer of analytes from the first to the second dimension. After initial experiments using homemade monolithic capillary columns, we tested commercially available columns in both dimensions. We ended with the combination of packed capillary columns in the first dimension and monolithic capillary column in the second dimension. We used a reversed-phase retention mechanism in the first spatial dimension, while HILIC was in the second, time-based dimension. We also developed a theoretical model to describe the proposed two-dimensional separation that was further confirmed by utilizing both an isocratic and gradient elution in the second dimension. Finally, we applied our experimental setup to separate neurotransmitters contained in human urine.
