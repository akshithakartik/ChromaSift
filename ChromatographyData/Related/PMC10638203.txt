Title: Characterization of pneumococcal serotype 7F in vaccine conjugation.

Abstract: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a highly invasive bacterial pathogen that can cause a range of illnesses. Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are the main virulence factors that causes invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Pneumococcal CPS serotype 7F along with a few other serotypes is more invasive and likely to cause IPD. Therefore, 7F is a target for pneumococcal vaccine development, and is included in the two recently approved multi-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccines, i.e. VAXNEUVANCE and PREVNAR 20.To support process and development of our 15-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV15), chromatographic methods have been developed for 7F polysaccharide and conjugate characterization. A size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) method with UV, light scattering and refractive index detections was employed for concentration, size and conformation analysis. A reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method was used for analysis of conjugate monosaccharide composition and degree of conjugation. The collective information obtained by these chromatographic analysis provided insights into the pneumococcal conjugate and conjugation process.
