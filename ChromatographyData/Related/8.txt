Title: Continuous multi-membrane chromatography of large viral particles

Abstract: Continuous multi-column chromatography (CMCC) has been successfully implemented to address biopharmaceutical biomolecule instability, to improve process efficiency, and to reduce facility footprint and capital cost. This paper explores the implementation of a continuous multi-membrane chromatography (CMMC) process, using four membrane units, for a large viral particle in just few weeks. CMMC improves the efficiency of the chromatography step by enabling higher loads with smaller membranes for multiple cycles of column use and enables steady-state continuous bioprocessing. The separation performance of CMMC was compared to a conventional batch chromatographic capture step used at full manufacturing scale. The product step yield was 80% using CMMC versus 65% in batch mode while increasing slightly the relative purity. Furthermore, the total amount of membrane area required for the CMMC approach was approximately 10% of the area needed for batch operation, while realizing similar processing times. Since CMMC uses smaller membrane sizes, it can take advantage of the high flow rates achievable for membrane chromatography that are not typically possible at larger membrane scales due to skid flow rate limitations. As such, CMMC offers the potential for more efficient and cost-effective purification trains.
