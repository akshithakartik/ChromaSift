Title: 15.01 Introduction to Applications IV. Bio-Organometallics, Metallo-Therapy, Metallo-Diagnostics, Medicine and Environmental Chemistry

Abstract: The volume “Applications IV. Bio-organometallics, metallo-therapy, metallo-diagnostics, medicine and environmental chemistry” is now established in Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry IV. However, it is unlikely to have existed for the first volumes of COMC. The application of organometallic drugs and the discovery of natural systems utilizing organometallic moieties is, nevertheless, nowadays a flourishing area of research. This volume assists bioinorganic chemists, coordination and medicinal chemists, and those interested in new-to-nature reactions. It also includes opportunities for green and sustainable organometallic catalysis. Nature's methods of employing organometallic chemistry for catalysis and human attempts to mimic nature's techniques by both building and optimizing synthetic analogs are examined in this volume, as well as the utilization of organometallic complexes to diagnose and treat diseases.
