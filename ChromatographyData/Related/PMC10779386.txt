Title: Glucans with Different Degrees of Polymerization from &lt;i&gt;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&lt;/i&gt; CICC6055: Analysis of Physicochemical Properties and Intestinal Prebiotic Function.

Abstract: This study explored the physicochemical properties and prebiotic activities of glucans and oligoglucans. Oligoglucans were obtained through the fermentation of &lt;i&gt;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&lt;/i&gt; CICC6055 and the glucansucrase of strain CICC6055, while glucans were obtained only through fermentation. Thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography identified enzymatically synthesized oligoglucans with a higher yield. Differential scanning calorimetry and derivative thermogravimetry analyses revealed the heat resistance of the glucans and oligoglucans at 280-300 \xc2\xb0C. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses demonstrated that their main chains were linked with \xce\xb1-1,6-glycosidic bonds accompanied by glucose residue branching. In vitro fermentation experiments demonstrated that they not only improved the contents of short-chain fatty acids but also raised the abundance of predominant flora, such as &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Verrucomicrobia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;. These results implicate glucansucrase as an efficacious tool for the enzyme synthesis of oligoglucans. Furthermore, both polysaccharides with different degrees of polymerization may be beneficial in maintaining a healthy human gut.
