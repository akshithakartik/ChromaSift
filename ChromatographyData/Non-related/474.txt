Title: The dependence of interfacial shear strength on temperature and matrix chemistry in glass fibre epoxy composites

Abstract: The present work focuses on a fundamental investigation into the influences of the chemistry of epoxy and the testing temperature on the stress-transfer capability of the fibreâ€“matrix interface in a glass fibre reinforced epoxy composite. We discuss how the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) is influenced by the hardener-to-resin ratio, testing temperature and fibre silane coating respectively. It was observed that the IFSS showed a significant inverse dependence on testing temperature for both silanes, with IFSS values dropping as the temperature was increased, for all ratios studied. Notably, it was shown that once the testing temperature was raised above the glass transition temperature that ratios possessing excess amine hardener had larger IFSS values. From the results presented it is hypothesized that residual radial compressive stresses at the interface are influenced by the chemistry of the matrix system and then relax away at the higher testing temperatures.
