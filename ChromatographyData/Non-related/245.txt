Title: Analytical advances to study the air – water interfacial chemistry in the atmosphere

Abstract: Formation of aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) at the air – liquid interface recently has attracted a lot of attention in atmospheric chemistry. The discrepancies in mass distributions, aerosol oxidative capacity, liquid water content, hygroscopic growth of aerosols, and formation of clouds and fogs suggest that interfacial chemistry play a more important role than previously deemed. However, detailed mechanisms at the air–water interface remain unclear owing to the lack of comprehensive understanding that underpins complicated interfacial phenomena, which are not easily measurable from field campaigns, laboratory measurements, or computational simulations. This review highlights relevant and recent technical advancement employed to study aqSOA encompassing spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The current knowledge on the aqSOA processes is digested with an emphasis on recent research of interfacial aqSOA formation including laboratory studies and model simulations. Finally, future directions of the interfacial chemistry are recommended for field and laboratory studies as well as theoretical efforts to resolve interfacial challenges in atmospheric chemistry.
