Title: Multi-attribute analysis of adeno-associated virus by size exclusion chromatography with fluorescence and triple-wavelength UV detection

Abstract: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is the leading platform for in vivo gene therapy to treat numerous genetic diseases. Comprehensive analysis of the AAV particles is essential to ensure desired safety and efficacy. An array of techniques is required to evaluate their critical quality attributes. However, many of these techniques are expensive, time-consuming, labour-intensive, and varying in accuracy. Size exclusion chromatography coupled with fluorescence and triple-wavelength ultraviolet detection (SEC-FLD-TWUV) and incorporating an aromatic amino acid of tryptophan as an internal standard offers a simple, rapid, and reliable approach for simultaneous multi-attribute analysis of AAVs. In the current study, we demonstrate its capability for AAV characterization and quantification, that includes capsid concentration, empty to full capsid ratio, vector genome concentration, and the presence of aggregates or fragments. All were performed in 20-min chromatographic runs with minimal sample handling. Data analysis involves the assessment of intrinsic fluorescence and UV absorbance of samples at three wavelengths that can be utilised to determine the content of the capsid protein and genome copy number. The separation efficiency using SEC columns with different pore sizes, and elution buffers of varying compositions, ionic strength, and pH values was also evaluated. This SEC-FLD-TWUV method may serve as a powerful yet cost-effective tool for responsive quality evaluation of AAVs. This may enhance performance, robustness, and safety of bioprocessing for AAV vectors to be used in gene therapy.
