Title: Low-cost modular chromatography column rack and vial holders

Abstract: Gravity-driven chromatography columns are used in scientific, engineering, medical, and industrial fields to separate desired compounds from solutions. Running multiple columns simultaneously saves time and improves procedural consistency. Though column chromatography is widely used, to meet their laboratory needs many investigators must resort to designing and fabricating custom racks for holding their chromatography columns. We have created a robust column rack design, with collection vial holders, that is easily made, inexpensive to build, and may be easily adapted to fit experimental needs. The column holder can be made to hold various sizes of columns (and can be interchanged as necessary); the height of columns above collection vials can be precisely set; and the design is modular, so the rack and vial holders can be expanded to accommodate the desired numbers of columns and the numbers and sizes of vials used to collect fractions eluted from each column. Importantly, the rack is made of inexpensive, readily–available materials and the fabrication is straightforward. Here we present details of the rack’s features, a list of materials, and instructions for making it. We hope our design will help investigators who perform gravity-driven column chromatography.
