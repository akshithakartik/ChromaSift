Title: Polyamidoamine with a hyper-branched structure grafted on modified magnetic graphene oxide for the trace separation of diclofenac and acetaminophen followed by high-performance liquid chromatography determination

Abstract: Different generations of polyamidoamine dendrimers were synthesized on a focal core of magnetic graphene oxide modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. After the characterization of synthesized dendrimers, its second generation was employed as a suitable sorbent for simultaneous separation/preconcentration of diclofenac and acetaminophen by a dispersive magnetic solid phase microextraction. The extracted analytes were then quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Under optimized conditions, the limits of detection were 0.3 µg/L for diclofenac and 0.1 µg/L for acetaminophen. The intra-day relative standard deviations at 50 μg L−1 levels were 1.8% for diclofenac and 2.1% for acetaminophen, while the inter-day relative standard deviations were 3.6% and 4.5% for diclofenac and acetaminophen, respectively. The calibration graphs were linear in ranges of 1.0–500.0 µg/L and 0.5–600.0 µg/L for diclofenac and acetaminophen, respectively, with good coefficients of determination (r2 > 0.998). The method was successfully applied to the determination of diclofenac and acetaminophen in water, milk, and biological samples.
