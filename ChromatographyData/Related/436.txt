Title: Screening strategy for 1210 exogenous chemicals in serum by two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry

Abstract: Humans are at risk of exogenous exposure to exogenous chemicals. Challenges exist for the comprehensive monitoring of residues with different physical and chemical properties in serum. Here, an on-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) - high resolution mass spectrometry system (HRMS) was developed, expanding the range of the partition coefficient in octanol/water of the residue analysis from −8 to 12. A high-coverage serum residue screening strategy was further designed by integrating 2D-LC system with HRMS full MS/data independent acquisition and automatic spectral library searching. This strategy enables to simultaneously screen 1210 pesticides, veterinary/human drugs, other chemical pollutants and their metabolites in serum with a single analysis. Method validation showed 92% and 81% of 1022 residues spiked in serum could be detected at 50 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL, respectively. The developed method was applied to the analysis of 24 separately pooled serum samples, 58 suspect residues were found, some of them were detected at high frequencies over than 50%. Among them, 4,6-Dinitro-O-cresol and probable carcinogenic folpet are highly toxic, and cimaterol is banned in China. Collectively, this study developed a 2D-LC-HRMS -based screening strategy for screening pesticides, veterinary/human drugs, and other chemical pollutants in serum, it is helpful for studying the effect of exogenous exposures on human health.
