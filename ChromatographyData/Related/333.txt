Title: On the low-temperature chemistry of 1,3-butadiene

Abstract: In this paper, species versus temperature profiles were measured during the oxidation of 1,3-butadiene in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) at 1 atm, at different equivalence ratios (φ = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0), in the temperature range 600 – 1020 K. Both synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) and gas chromatography (GC) methods were used to analyze the species. The experimental results show that a large proportion of the products are aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, etc.) and ketenes (ketene, methyl-ketene), with acrolein being one of the major products. Moreover, furan, 1,3-cyclopentadiene and benzene are also present as intermediates in significant amounts. The reaction pathways leading to the formation of these species are discussed in detail. A new detailed mechanism, NUIGMech1.3, was developed to simulate these new data as well as other experimental data available in the literature. The validation results indicate that quantum calculations are also needed to explore the formation of some important species formed in the oxidation of 1,3-butadiene. Overall, the new 1,3-butadiene mechanism agrees well with various experimental data in the low- to high-temperature regimes and at different pressures. Flux and sensitivity analyses show that 1,3-butadiene shares some common reaction chemistry pathways with 1- and 2-butene via Ḣ atom and HȮ2 radical addition to the C = C double bond in 1,3-butadiene, reactions which are important for both systems. The low temperature chemistry of 1,3-butadiene is mainly controlled by the reaction pathways of ȮH radical addition to the C = C double bond of the fuel molecule. The 1-buten-4-ol-3-yl radicals so formed subsequently add to O2 and react via the Waddington mechanism, which is important in accurately simulating the oxidation and auto-ignition of 1,3-butadiene at engine relevant conditions.
