Title: Surface chemistry applications and development of immunosensors using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy: A comprehensive review

Abstract: Immunosensors are promising alternatives as detection platforms for the current gold standards methods. Electrochemical immunosensors have already proven their capability for the sensitive, selective, detection of target biomarkers specific to COVID-19, varying cancers or Alzheimer's disease, etc. Among the electrochemical techniques, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a highly sensitive technique which examines the impedance of an electrochemical cell over a range of frequencies. There are several important critical requirements for the construction of successful impedimetric immunosensor. The applied surface chemistry and immobilisation protocol have impact on the electroanalytical performance of the developed immunosensors. In this Review, we summarise the building blocks of immunosensors based on EIS, including self-assembly monolayers, nanomaterials, polymers, immobilisation protocols and antibody orientation.
