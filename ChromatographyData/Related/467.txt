Title: Characterization of the key aroma compounds in soy sauce by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry, headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry, odor activity value, and aroma recombination and omission analysis

Abstract: Most previous studies on volatile compounds in soy sauce were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In this study, the volatile compounds of high-salt liquid-state fermentation soy sauce (HLFSS) were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by GC–MS and headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS). One hundred and seventy-four substances were detected using the two instruments, 87 by HS-GC-IMS and 127 by GC–MS. Aldehydes (26), ketones (28), esters (29), and alcohols (26) were the main compounds in HLFSS. In addition, ethyl pyruvate, (E)-2-pentenal and diethyl propanedioate were detected by HS-GC-IMS, which were previously not detected in HLFSS. Forty-eight aromatics including 34 key ones were identified by gas chromatography–olfactometry. Phenylacetaldehyde, methional, 2-methylbutanal, 1-octen-3-ol, ethyl acetate, 2-ethyl-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone and 4-ethyl guaiacol were identified as the main aroma compounds in HLFSS by aroma recombination and omission test. This study laid foundation for developing flavor assessment standards for soy sauce.
