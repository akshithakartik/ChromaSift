Title: Characterization of Chilean hot spring-origin Staphylococcus sp. BSP3 produced exopolysaccharide as biological additive.

Abstract: A type of high molecular weight bioactive polymers called exopolysaccharides (EPS) are produced by thermophiles, the extremophilic microbes that thrive in acidic environmental conditions of hot springs with excessively warm temperatures. Over time, EPS became important as natural biotechnological additives because of their noncytotoxic, emulsifying, antioxidant, or immunostimulant activities. In this article, we unravelled a new EPS produced by\xc2\xa0Staphylococcus sp. BSP3 from an acidic (pH 6.03) San Pedro hot spring (38.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) located in the central Andean mountains in Chile. Several physicochemical techniques were performed to characterize the EPS structure including Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), 1D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was confirmed that the amorphous surface of the BSP3 EPS, composed of rough pillar-like nanostructures, is evenly distributed. The main EPS monosaccharide constituents were mannose (72%), glucose (24%) and galactose (4%). Also, it is a medium molecular weight (43.7\xc2\xa0kDa) heteropolysaccharide. NMR spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of a [\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x80\x896)-\xe2\x8d\xba-D-Manp-(1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x80\x896)-\xe2\x8d\xba-D-Manp-(1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x86\x92] backbone 2-O substituted with 1-\xe2\x8d\xba-D-Manp. A high thermal stability of EPS (287\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) was confirmed by TGA analysis. Emulsification, antioxidant, flocculation, water-holding (WHC), and oil-holding (OHC) capacities are \xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89also studied for biotechnological industry applications. The results demonstrated that BSP3 EPS could be used as a biodegradable material for different purposes, like flocculation and natural additives in product formulation.
