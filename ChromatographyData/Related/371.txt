Title: Determination of restricted dyes in textile raw material solid wastes by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry

Abstract: A rapid and highly sensitive method for the quantification of 34 restricted dyes (including acid, basic, disperse, direct, and azo dyes) in solid textile raw material wastes was developed by employing ultrasonic extraction coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(UHPLC-MS/MS). More specifically, the proposed method employed methanol as the extraction solvent, while the mobile phases consisted of acetonitrile and 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate + 0.05% ammonia. A good linearity was achieved over the concentration range of 0.01–200 ng/mL with correlation coefficients (R) between 0.991–0.999, limits of detection (LODs) of 0.25–40.0 µg/kg (S/N = 3) and limits of quantification (LOQs) of 0.84–133.4 µg/kg (S/N = 10). 34 dyes were recovered at three levels ranging from 84.5 to 106.9% with relative standard deviation (RSDs) ranging from 0.59% to 10.61%. Further, the method was applied for the accurate analysis of 32 counts of cotton yarn, waste cotton, and printed fabrics within 15 min. The dyestuffs accurately quantified by this rapid chromatographic procedure covered a wide range of carcinogenic and allergenic dyestuffs listed in the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 (version 02.2023) colourants. The ultrasound technique combined with the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method proposed in this work is thus suitable for the rapid screening, confirmation, and quantitative detection of industrial synthetic dyes within solid waste originating from textile raw materials.
