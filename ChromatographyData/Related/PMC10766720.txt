Title: Automated micro-solid-phase extraction clean-up and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of pesticides in foods extracted with ethyl acetate.

Abstract: Generic extraction methods for the multi-compound pesticide analysis of food have found their solid place in laboratories. Ethyl acetate and acetonitrile extraction methods have been developed as fast and easy to handle standard multi-compound methods, both feature benefits and limitations. The direct injection to gas chromatography can be impaired by a high burden of coextracted matrix, resulting in deterioration of the chromatographic system and matrix effects, requiring frequent maintenance. Therefore, common clean-up methods, such as dispersive solid-phase extraction, freeze-out of fats, or gel permeation chromatography, have been applied in clean-up. Automated clean-up using micro-solid-phase extraction (\xc2\xb5SPE) is a recent development with several demonstrated advantages when employed in the analysis of pesticides and other contaminants in foods extracted with acetonitrile, but it has not yet been evaluated in this application using ethyl acetate for extraction. In this study, an automated procedure using \xc2\xb5SPE cartridges was developed and established on an x,y,z robotic sampler for the raw extract clean-up and preparation of diluted samples for injection on a GC-MS/MS system. Validation experiments for 212 pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in lettuce, avocado, raspberry, paprika, egg, and liver extracts were performed using \xc2\xb5SPE with MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, PSA, C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;, and CarbonX. The performance in routine operation is briefly discussed.
