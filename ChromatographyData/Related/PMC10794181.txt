Title: GC/MS and LC/MS serum metabolomic analysis of Chinese LN patients.

Abstract: China, being a densely populated nation, faces a substantial economic burden due to a high incidence of lupus nephritis (LN) cases. The concealed onset of LN has resulted in many individuals have missed the optimal timing for treatment. The aim of the research is to study the serum metabolomics of Chinese LN patients using gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)/MS to identify potential diagnostic markers. Fifty LN patients and fifty normal controls, matched for Body Mass Index (BMI) and age, were selected. Serum analysis was conducted using GC/MS and LC/MS, followed by multivariate statistical analysis. Various multidimensional analyses, including principal component analysis, partial least squares discrimination analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis, along with one-dimensional analyses such as t-tests, were performed. Metabolites with variable importance in projection value\xe2\x80\x89&gt;\xe2\x80\x891 and a p-value\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05 were considered critical biomarkers for LN. Furthermore, identified biomarkers delineated relevant metabolic pathways, and a metabolic pathway map was obtained from the database. Forty-one metabolites were identified as potential LN biomarkers, primarily associated with immune regulation, energy metabolism, intestinal microbial metabolism, renal damage, and oxidative stress. The potential for diagnosing LN and other diseases through metabolomics is demonstrated. Future research should explore larger sample sizes, metabolomic comparisons across different diseases and health states, and integration of metabolomics with clinical diagnostics. Such studies will enhance the understanding of metabolomics in medical diagnosis and provide robust support for its practical application.
