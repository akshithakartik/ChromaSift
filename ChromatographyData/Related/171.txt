Title: Establishment of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and cluster of differentiation 147 dual target cell membrane chromatography based on SNAP-tag technology for screening anti severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 active components

Abstract: Patients have different responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and these may be life-threatening for critically ill patients. Screening components that act on host cell receptors, especially multi-receptor components, is challenging. The in-line combination of dual-targeted cell membrane chromatography and a liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) system for analyzing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) receptors based on SNAP-tag technology provides a comprehensive solution for screening multiple components in complex samples acting on the two receptors. The selectivity and applicability of the system were validated with encouraging results. Under the optimized conditions, this method was used to screen for antiviral components in Citrus aurantium extracts. The results showed that 25 Âµmol /L of the active ingredient could inhibit virus entry into cells. Hesperidin, neohesperidin, nobiletin, and tangeretin were identified as antiviral components. In vitro pseudovirus assays and macromolecular cell membrane chromatography further verified the interaction of these four components with host-virus receptors, showing good effects on some or all of the pseudoviruses and host receptors. In conclusion, the in-line dual-targeted cell membrane chromatography LC-MS system developed in this study can be used for the comprehensive screening of antiviral components in complex samples. It also provides new insight into small-molecule drug-receptor and macromolecular-protein-receptor interactions.
