Title: Computational framework for the techno-economic analysis of monoclonal antibody capture chromatography platforms

Abstract: We developed a computational framework that integrates commercial software components to perform customizable technoeconomic feasibility analyses. The use of multiple software packages overcomes the shortcomings of each to provide a detailed simulation that can be used for sensitivity analyses and optimizations. In this paper, the framework was used to evaluate the performance of monoclonal antibody capture processes. To this end, the simulation framework incorporated dynamic models for the affinity chromatography step that were validated with experimental breakthrough curves. The results were integrated with an Intelligen SuperPro Designer process simulation for the evaluation of key performance indicators of the operations. As proof of concept, the framework was used to perform a sensitivity analysis and optimization for a case study in which we sought to compare membrane and resin chromatography for disposable and reusable batch capture platforms. Two membranes and one resin were selected for the capture media, which yielded six process alternatives to compare. The objective functions were set to be cost of goods, process time, and buffer utilization. The results of the optimization of these process alternatives were a set of operating conditions that display tradeoffs between competing objectives. From this application exercise, we conclude that the framework can handle multiple variables and objectives, and it is adaptable to platforms with different chromatography media and operating modes. Additionally, the framework is capable of providing ad hoc analyses for decision making in a specific production context.
