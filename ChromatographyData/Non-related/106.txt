Title: Computer vision-assisted smartphone microscope imaging digital immunosensor based on click chemistry-mediated microsphere counting technology for the detection of aflatoxin B1 in peanuts

Abstract: Aflatoxin B1 is a carcinogenic contaminant in food or feed, and it poses a serious health risk to humans. Herein, a computer vision-assisted smartphone microscope imaging digital (SMID) immunosensor based on the click chemistry-mediated microsphere counting technology was designed for the detection of aflatoxin B1 in peanuts. In this SMID immunosensor, the modified polystyrene (PS) microspheres were used as the signal probes and were recorded by a smartphone microscopic imaging system after immunoreaction and click chemistry reaction. The number of PS probes is adjusted by aflatoxin B1. The customized computer vision procedure was used to efficiently identify and count the obtained PS probes. This SMID immunosensor enables sensitive detection of aflatoxin B1 with a linear range from 0.001 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL, providing a simple, sensitive, and portable tool for food safety supervision.
