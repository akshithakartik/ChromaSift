Title: Contribution of molecular structures and quantum chemistry technique to root concentration factor: An innovative application of interpretable machine learning

Abstract: Root concentration factor (RCF) is a significant parameter to characterize uptake and accumulation of hazardous organic contaminants (HOCs) by plant roots. However, complex interactions among chemicals, plant roots and soil make it challenging to identify underlying mechanisms of uptake and accumulation of HOCs. Here, nine machine learning techniques were applied to investigate major factors controlling RCF based on variable combinations of molecular descriptors (MD), MACCS fingerprints, quantum chemistry descriptors (QCD) and three physicochemical properties related to chemical-soil-plant system. Compared to models with variables including MACCS fingerprints or solitary physicochemical properties, the XGBoost-6 model developed by the variable combination of MD, QCD and three physicochemical properties achieved the most remarkable performance, with R

Model interpretation achieved by permutation variable importance and partial dependence plots revealed the vital importance of HOCs lipophilicity, lipid content of plant roots, soil organic matter content, the overall deformability and the molecular dispersive ability of HOCs for regulating RCF. The integration of MD and QCD with physicochemical properties could improve our knowledge of underlying mechanisms regarding HOCs accumulation in plant roots from innovative structural perspectives. Multiple variables combination-oriented performance improvement of model can be extended to other parameters prediction in environmental risk assessment field.
