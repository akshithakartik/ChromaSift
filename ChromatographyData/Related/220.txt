Title: Separation and analysis of six fractions in low temperature coal tar by column chromatography

Abstract: The low temperature coal tar (CT) is taken as the raw material, and the extraction and column chromatography are used for detailed and accurate characterization in this paper. The n-heptane soluble fraction (CT-HS) and insoluble fraction (CT-HI) were obtained by n-heptane Soxhlet extraction. The extraction rate of CT-HS reached 92.79% (mass), which indicated that there are few heavy compounds in it. Further, different solvents (methylbenzene, benzene, ethyl acetate, methylbenzene-ethanol) were used to elute CT-HS by chromatographic column to obtain five fractions (saturates, aromatics, heteroatoms, phenolics and resins, named CT-SA, CT-AR, CT-HE, CT-PH, CT-RE, respectively). The yields of CT-SA, CT-AR, CT-HE, CT-PH, CT-RE are 42.12%, 10.43%, 2.19%, 9.50% and 6.63% (mass), respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of eluting components show that alkanes are the main components in CT, followed by polycyclic aromatics, and the corresponding fractions are CT-SA and CT-AR, respectively. The relative content of aliphatics in CT-SA is 76.93%, and the relative content of aromatics in CT-AR is 75.05%. This separation technology effectively separates and enriches different components in CT, and the activation energy required for the pyrolysis process of a single eluting fraction is lower than that of CT, which is expected to provide an important reference for the separation, analysis and conversion of complex oil products such as coal-oil co-processing products, coal tar and other complex heavy carbon oil products.
