Title: Time-dependent dielectric density functional theory predictions for excited-state molecular properties using neural networks guided by lower-level quantum chemistry

Abstract: This paper discusses a neural network approach for the prediction of ground- and excited-state molecular properties. The time-dependent dielectric density functional theory was employed to handle the excited state of coumarin-152 dye. We demonstrated that lower-level quantum chemistry techniques, such as the semiempirical method and the Hartreeâ€“Fock approximations, can be used to improve the predictive performance of neural network models. The semiempirical quantum chemistry method provided excellent feature vectors (descriptors) on excited-state molecular properties in terms of computational cost and performance. In addition, a vector-based descriptor to improve molecular-force predictions is discussed.
