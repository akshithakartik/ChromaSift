Title: Comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography in food analysis. Is any sample preparation necessary?

Abstract: Comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) is a valuable and powerful tool for the analysis of complex real-world samples. The present review paper highlights the advantages, arising from the coupling of two different liquid chromatography separations in the sector of food analysis. The first part is devoted to both theoretical and practical considerations about method optimization; on the other hand, selected applications pertaining to polyphenol, triacylglycerol and carotenoid analysis where no sample preparation is needed (green approach) are reported and discussed. In this context, the LC × LC methodology become a promising greener and ecofriendly alternative that may reduce analysis time and solvent consumption.
