Title: Green analytical chemistry approaches on environmental analysis

Abstract: Green analytical chemistry is a comprehensive perspective that aims to reduce or eliminate the toxic and harmful solvents, reagents, and techniques in the preparation, pre-treatment, and determination steps of an analysis process. With the increase in environmental pollution in recent years, awareness has been increasing in terms of both the contamination analysis of environmental sources and the more environmentally friendly analysis methods. This review evaluates the solvents such as bio-based solvents and deep eutectic solvents, nanomaterials synthesized by non-toxic methods, the greener changes in the extraction methods, and chromatographic techniques considering the most recent studies. In particular, trying to make the methods used to analyze environmental samples safer and less toxic is an important point that overlaps with the green approach, which aims to minimize environmental pollution. In this context, this review provides information on green analytical chemistry-based environmental applications covering the last ten years so that the applications of this approach can be examined and understood in more detail and can be applied by other researchers.
