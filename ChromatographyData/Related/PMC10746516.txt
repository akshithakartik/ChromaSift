Title: Isolating plasma extracellular vesicles from mouse blood using size-exclusion chromatography, density gradient, and ultracentrifugation.

Abstract: Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) could serve for the surveillance of diverse pathological conditions. We present a protocol for enriching and isolating plasma EVs from mouse blood. We describe steps for employing ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography, and density gradients, required for further quantitative and qualitative analysis. We detail the procedure for retrieving optimal volume of blood while preserving its integrity and avoiding hemolysis. We also describe the preparation of EVs from this complex fluid containing soluble proteins, aggregates, and lipoprotein particles. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Andr\xc3\xa9-Gr\xc3\xa9goire et\xc2\xa0al. (2022).&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
