Title: Applications of ion chromatography in urine analysis: A review

Abstract: Ion chromatography (IC) plays a crucial role in urine analysis for diverse medical diagnoses. This paper reviews a comprehensive investigation into urine pretreatment techniques, as well as the design and development of IC systems for the measurement of various chemicals. Prior to analysis, urine samples commonly undergo pretreatment procedures such as dilution, filtration, purification, and concentration. These steps effectively eliminate interfering factors and facilitate the accurate and sensitive analysis of ultra-trace components. To separate and quantify different chemical elements or ions present in urine, a range of homemade or commercially available columns coupled with various detectors were employed. This study focuses on the analysis of chemicals such as heavy metals, halogens, pesticides, drugs, and other essential or toxic substances by IC methods.
