Title: Advances in the Application of Liquid Chromatography in the Detection of Pollutants.

Abstract: Food is easy to be contaminated because of its complex composition. Therefore, in order to protect people from potential food contaminants, it is very necessary to test for various contaminants in food. Liquid chromatography is widely used in the field of food safety detection. In addition, with the development of liquid chromatography technology, more and more new instruments are combined with liquid chromatography. Compared with traditional liquid chromatography, combined liquid chromatography has great advantages in efficiency and operation. Therefore, it is rapidly promoted in the field of food safety testing. In this paper, the results of the determination of three kinds of food pollutants by different liquid chromatography methods are reviewed, and the indexes are compared and analyzed.
