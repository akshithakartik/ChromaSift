Title: Evaluation of advanced liquid–liquid chromatography operating modes for the tetrahydrocannabinol-remediation of hemp extracts

Abstract: The presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in cannabinoid-based materials, such as hemp flower extracts, can pose a severe commercialization burden. In this study, various operating modes of liquid–liquid chromatography (LLC), i.e., batch mode (conventional), trapping multiple dual mode (semi-continuous), and sequential mode (continuous), were evaluated for the THC-remediation of hemp extracts. The biphasic system composition, the feed concentration range, and the maximum flow rate were selected in preliminary experiments. The operating parameters were chosen using short-cut methods, whereas simulations were based on the equilibrium-cell model. Batch elution provided good productivity, easy operation, and yielded a THC-free hemp extract. Trapping multiple dual mode showed a lower productivity than batch, whereas the sequential mode afforded a THC-free extract with a similar composition to the batch mode and offered the advantage of continuous operation and superior productivity. The results of this work constitute a solid basis for the model-based design and optimization of LLC processes for the industrial remediation of hemp extracts.
