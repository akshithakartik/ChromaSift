Title: Utility of “flip-flop” chromatography employing silica hydride stationary phases with simultaneous photodiode array ultraviolet and single quadrupole mass detection for the analysis of seized drugs

Abstract: For confirmation and/or screening purposes, rapid, selective, and precise chromatographic methods are required. In this vein, the utility of SiH columns (C18, UDC Cholesterol, and Diamond Hydride) with photodiode array UV absorption and single quadrupole MS detection for multi-modal separation of representative drugs from different drug classes on a single column using the same solvent reservoirs was investigated. For a conventional two column approach employing a combination of conventional C18 and silica columns operating in both the reversed phase chromatographic and hydrophilic interaction chromatographic modes, gradient analysis is required for the first column and there is a lack of retention on the second column for non-amine analytes. In comparison, all analytes are retained for two relatively rapid (< 10 min), precise (% RSD <0.4%), and non-correlated isocratic separations (R2=0.2115) when using a UDC Cholesterol column.
