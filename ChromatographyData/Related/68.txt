Title: Chiral metal-organic frameworks and their composites as stationary phases for liquid chromatography chiral separation: A minireview

Abstract: Chiral metal organic frameworks (CMOFs) are a kind of crystal porous framework material that has attracted increasing attention due to the customizable combination of metal nodes and organic ligands. In particular, the highly ordered crystal structure and rich adjustable chiral structure make it a promising material for developing new chiral separation material systems. In this review, the progress of CMOFs and their different types of composites used as chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in liquid chromatography for enantioseparation are discussed. The characteristics of CMOFs and their composites are summarized, aiming to provide new ideas for the development of CMOFs with better performance and further promote the application of CMOFs materials in enantioselective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
