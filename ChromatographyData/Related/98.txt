Title: A portable liquid chromatography system based on a separation/detection chip module consisting of a replaceable ultraviolet-visible absorbance or contactless conductivity detection unit

Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing demand for miniaturized analytical instruments, including portable HPLC systems, that can enable rapid analysis in the field. This study aimed to develop chip-based separation/detection modules with replaceable detection units for constructing compact HPLC systems to minimize the dead volume. This module provides a tubing-free connection between the column and the detection unit. This study also built detection units for conductivity detection and ultraviolet-visible (UVâ€“Vis) detection to cover a wide variety of inorganic and organic compounds. Furthermore, UV- and Vis-light-emitting diodes were employed for the absorbance detection unit. In addition, portable all-in-one HPLC systems and a handy HPLC system were constructed for ion chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography, demonstrating the successful separation and detection of inorganic ions and several organic compounds.
