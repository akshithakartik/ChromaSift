Title: Bacterial nitric oxide reductase (NorBC) models employing click chemistry

Abstract: Bacterial NO Reductase (NorBC or cNOR) is a membrane-bound enzyme found in denitrifying bacteria that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of NO to N2O and water. The mechanism by which NorBC operates is highly debated, due to the fact that this enzyme is difficult to work with, and no intermediates of the NO reduction reaction could have been identified so far. The unique active site of NorBC consists of a heme b

In this paper, we present three new synthetic model systems for NorBC, consisting of a tetraphenylporphyrin-derivative clicked to modified BMPA-based ligands (BMPA = bis(methylpyridyl)amine) that model the non-heme site in the enzyme. These complexes have been characterized by EPR, IR and UV–Vis spectroscopy. The reactivity with NO was then investigated, and it was found that the complex with the BMPA-carboxylate ligand as the non-heme component has a very low affinity for NO at the non-heme iron site. If the carboxylate functional group is replaced with a phenolate or pyridine group, reactivity is restored and formation of a diiron dinitrosyl complex was observed. Upon one-electron reduction of the nitrosylated complexes, following the semireduced pathway for NO reduction, formation of dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) was observed in all three cases, but no N2O could be detected.
