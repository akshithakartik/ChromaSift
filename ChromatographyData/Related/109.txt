Title: Inosine 5′- monophosphate derived umami taste intensity of beef determination by electrochemistry and chromatography

Abstract: The umami sensation contributes to beef taste and acceptability. Inosine 5′- monophosphate (IMP), the most abundant 5′-ribonucleotide in meat, is known to impart an umami taste without the undesired side effects commonly associated with glutamate. Nevertheless, the investigation of IMP's role in beef flavor has thus far been overlooked. Traditional methods for detecting IMP have relied on liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet spectroscopy or mass spectrometry techniques. However, these methods are not practical for production settings due to the complexity and resource demands of sophisticated laboratory techniques. Alternative methods like cyclic voltammetry might offer more practical solutions for rapidly detecting IMP. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficiency of using electrochemistry and chromatography on differentiating beef strips spiked with different IMP contents. The IMP threshold was 0.30 mM determined by a trained panel using the Best Estimates Threshold method. Beef strip steaks of USDA Prime, Choice, and Select were spiked at 0.30 and 0.60 mM of IMP, based on green weight and an estimated moisture content of 65%. In this study, differences in the IMP content of steaks were not detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, the cyclic voltammetry approach differentiated IMP concentrations at 0.50 mM or above in aqueous solutions and subsequentially meat extracts from the buffered blank solutions. In conclusion, cyclic voltammetry holds potential as a rapid and effective approach for detecting IMP in beef and other meat products, offering promising applications for future research.
