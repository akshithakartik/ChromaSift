Title: White analytical chemistry approaches for analytical and bioanalytical techniques: Applications and challenges

Abstract: The detection of various hazardous compounds (i.e., pesticides, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals etc.) in food, biological and environmental samples is crucial for food safety, clinical studies and environmental analysis. Main drawbacks of the analytical techniques towards these compounds are selectivity, efficiency, total cost of the analysis and sustainability. To overcome these drawbacks, white analytical chemistry is a great approach which should be considered during the detection of the target compound/s. It covers the main principles of green chemistry and also takes into account aspects of the quality of the analytical method, practical and economical use.
                  In this paper, the recent progresses in the white analytical chemistry-based biological, food and environmental applications are discussed. Although the term “white analytical chemistry” has not been used, the principles of this approach have been successfully evaluated in most of these studies. Herein, it is mainly intended to apply this approach to reported studies.
