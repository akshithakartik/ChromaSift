Title: Mechanochemistry: A sustainable chemistry path

Abstract: Francesco Puccetti earned his MSc in organic chemistry and synthetic procedures at the University of Florence (Italy) in 2018, after two research stays at the University of Alicante (Spain) and RWTH Aachen University (Germany). Afterward, he moved back to Aachen for his doctoral studies, focusing on mechanosynthetic protocols and reaction monitoring, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Carsten Bolm. He further expanded his experience in this field by spending time in research groups at the Ruđer Bošković Institute (Croatia) and Hokkaido University (Japan). He graduated in January 2023.
