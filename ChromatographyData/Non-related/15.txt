Title: Flow chemistry as green technology for the genesis and use of organometallic reagents in the synthesis of key building blocks and APIs â€“ An update

Abstract: The advent of flow chemistry and flow microreactor technology in organic synthesis has added a series of options to the toolbox of synthetic chemists by enabling access to chemical reactions, which had hitherto been little explored or impossible in classical batch methods. In this review article, we provide an update on recent reports (published since 2020) showcasing examples of flow technology enabling the genesis and use of highly reactive organometallic intermediates for the synthesis of key building blocks and active pharmaceutical ingredients. In addition to showcasing the known advantages of flow technology (e.g., safety, scalability and productivity) we also highlight its positive impact on the greenness of organic reactions.
