Title: Extraction of Active Compounds from Mixtures of Hemp (&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt;) with Plants of the &lt;i&gt;Zingiberaceae&lt;/i&gt; Family.

Abstract: Hemp is probably one of the most studied plants for its health-promoting properties, with countless documented and patented extraction methods, but literature is scarce on the simultaneous extraction of mixture of raw materials. Hemp, along with other plant materials, could represent a potentially highly valuable source material with resulting reciprocal effects. In this study, hemp (&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt;) and three members of the &lt;i&gt;Zingiberaceae&lt;/i&gt; family, ginger (&lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt;), turmeric (&lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt;), and cardamom (&lt;i&gt;Elettaria cardamomum&lt;/i&gt;), were extracted simultaneously, and their bioactive component values were investigated. Two extraction methods were used, namely ultrasound-assisted extraction with ethanol and supercritical fluid extraction with carbon dioxide. First, extracts were obtained from separate plant materials. Then, hemp was extracted in combination with ginger, turmeric, and cardamom in a 1:1 ratio. The extracts obtained were evaluated for their antioxidant activity and total phenolic content using UV/VIS spectrophotometry; cannabinoid content, 6-gingerol, and 6-shogaol were measured using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); volatile components such as 1,8-cineole, alpha-terpinyl acetate, linalool, and aR-turmerone were measured using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
