Title: Profiling of Volatile Compounds in \'Muscat Hamburg\' Contaminated with &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus carbonarius&lt;/i&gt; before OTA Biosynthesis Based on HS-SPME-GC-MS and DLLME-GC-MS.

Abstract: &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus carbonarius&lt;/i&gt; is known to produce the carcinogenic ochratoxin A (OTA) in grapes. The metabolism process before OTA biosynthesis influences the content and composition of the volatile compounds in grapes. In this study, a self-established method based on QuEChERS coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) was used to determine the OTA levels during a seven-day contamination period. The results showed that OTA was detected on the second day after contamination with &lt;i&gt;A. carbonarius&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, the first day was considered as the critical sampling timepoint for analyzing the volatiles in grapes before OTA biosynthesis. Additionally, the volatile compounds in grapes were analyzed using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (DLLME-GC-MS). The corresponding data were evaluated via multivariate data analysis using projection methods, including PCA and OPLS-DA. The results indicated significant differences in the nine volatile compounds in grapes contaminated with &lt;i&gt;A. carbonarius&lt;/i&gt; before OTA biosynthesis. The results of the Pearson correlation analysis showed positive correlations between ethyl acetate, styrene, 1-hexanol and OTA; (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-2-hexenal and nerolic acid were negatively correlated with OTA. Overall, these findings provide a theoretical basis for the early prediction of OTA formation in grape and grape products using GC-MS technology.
