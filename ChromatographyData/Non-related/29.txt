Title: Bioorthogonal chemistry-driven anticancer nanotherapeutics

Abstract: Bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a promising approach for anticancer applications, enabling targeted tumor detection, imaging, and therapeutic interventions. Particularly, the ingenious encounter of bioorthogonal chemistry and biomedical nanotechnology has opened up new avenues for precise diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors. Given the remarkable advancements in bioorthogonal chemistry-driven anticancer nanotherapeutics, it is imperative to review the latest breakthroughs. Herein, we aim to outline the emerging trends in the fields at the intersection of bioorthogonal chemistry and biomedical nanotechnology for precision cancer theranostics, with special attention on bioorthogonal chemistry-driven tumor-targeting modalities, nanoprobes, and nanomedicines. This review underscores the rationale, advantages, and challenges of integrating bioorthogonal chemistry with biomedical nanotechnology and tumor biology to develop desirable anticancer nanotherapeutics.
