Title: Clickable periodic mesoporous organosilicas core-shell particles with radially-oriented mesopores for high-performance liquid chromatography

Abstract: It is important to explore well-defined materials to further improve the performance of chromatographic stationary phase. Periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) with uniform-distributed organic functionalities and high chemical stability is rising star of chromatography. In this work, ethylene-bridged PMO with excellent organization over distances of several dozen nm was coated on silica cores to form core-shell particles with radially-oriented mesopores. The separation performance for naphthalene was 9.7 × 104 plates/m after derivatization of the C18 group on the terminal vinyl of vinyltriethoxysilane by “thiol-ene” click reaction. These hybrid core-shell particles had good mechanical strength, as well as adequate chemical stability (0.1%TEA, pH 9.5), so it has the potential for HPLC separation.
