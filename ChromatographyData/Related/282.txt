Title: Characterization of antithrombin isoforms and latent forms by ion exchange chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry

Abstract: Antithrombin is a key protein of the coagulation system belonging to the serine protease inhibitor family. Antithrombin preparations are used as a therapeutic treatment for patients with decreased antithrombin activity. Elucidating the structural features of this protein is an important part of the control strategy to assure a high quality. This study presents an ion exchange chromatographic method coupled to mass spectrometry capable of characterizing antithrombin post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation, phosphorylation or deamidation. Furthermore, the method was successfully used to evidence irreversible/inactive conformers of antithrombin which are commonly observed for serine protease inhibitors and referred to as latent forms.
