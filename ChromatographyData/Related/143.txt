Title: Determination of underivatized amino acids in human plasma using ion pair liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry

Abstract: Accurate quantification of amino acids (AA) is essential for several applications, including clinical research, food analysis, and pharmaceutical studies. In this study, we developed an analytical method based on liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-ESI-MS/MS). This method was devised to accurately quantify a spectrum of amino acids, notably taurine, creatinine, glutathione (GSH), and sulfur-containing amino acids (SAAs) such as methionine, cysteine, and homocysteine, using only 10 μL of human plasma. A stable isotope derivative of each AA is used as an internal standard (IS) for accurate quantification. For retention and separation on a C18 column, heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) was employed as an ion pair agent. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive mode with the precursor-to-product ion transitions at m/z is used for quantification. The method showed excellent linearity for all AA with a high correlation coefficient (r > 0.9927). The linear fit indicates that the detector response is linear over the tested range of standard concentrations. The accuracy and precision of the method were within the acceptable range of 92–110% and < 15%, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were in the range of 0.001–1.80 µM and 0.004–6.0 µM, respectively. No significant ion suppression or carry over was observed. In conclusion, the assay was validated and found to have adequate accuracy, precision, linearity, sensitivity and selectivity. The assay has been successfully applied to the analysis of human plasma.
