Title: Evaluation of the Robustness Verification of Downstream Production Process for Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine and Different Chromatography Medium Purification Effects.

Abstract: &lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Large-scale vaccine production requires downstream processing that focuses on robustness, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;To assess the robustness of the current vaccine production process, three batches of COVID-19 Omicron BA.1 strain hydrolytic concentrated solutions were selected. Four gel filtration chromatography media (Chromstar 6FF, Singarose FF, Bestarose 6B, and Focurose 6FF) and four ion exchange chromatography media (Maxtar Q, Q Singarose, Diamond Q, and Q Focurose) were used to evaluate their impact on vaccine purification. The quality of the vaccine was assessed by analyzing total protein content, antigen content, residual Vero cell DNA, residual Vero cell protein, and residual bovine serum albumin (BSA). Antigen recovery rate and specific activity were also calculated. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate process robustness and the purification effects of the chromatography media.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in antigen recovery (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.10), Vero HCP residue (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.59), Vero DNA residue (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.28), and BSA residue (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.97) among the three batches of hydrolytic concentrated solutions processed according to the current method. However, a significant difference (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) was observed in antigen content.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The study demonstrated the remarkable robustness of the current downstream process for producing WIBP-CorV vaccines. This process can adapt to different batches of hydrolytic concentrated solutions and various chromatography media. The research is crucial for the production of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and provides a potential template for purifying other viruses.
