Title: Recent advances in the chemistry of selenophenoquinoline heterocycles: Synthesis, reactivity and biological activity

Abstract: Indeed, quinoline and selenophene are highly advantageous heterocyclic compounds that serve as significant building blocks for the development of new drug entities. The combination of selenophene and quinoline moieties in hybrid molecules offers a wide range of potential pharmacological activities and has led to the discovery of selenophenoquinolines (selenopheno [2,3-b]quinoline, selenopheno[3,2-b]quinoline, selenopheno [2,3-c]quinoline, selenopheno [3,2-c]quinoline, and selenopheno [4,5-c]quinoline) with interesting properties. The preparation of selenophenoquinolines can be achieved through the following chemical reactions: Friedländer reaction, Thorpe–Ziegler cyclization, Vilsmeier–Haack formylation, Sonogashira and Suzuki cross-coupling reaction.
