Title: Evaluating the effect of glycation on lipase activity using boronate affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry

Abstract: Protein glycation may occur naturally when reducing sugars and proteins coexist, which is often the case for industrial enzymes. The impact of post-translational modifications on enzyme performance (e.g., stability or function) is often not predictable, highlighting the importance of having appropriate analytical methodologies to monitor the influence of glycation on performance. Here, a boronate affinity chromatography method was developed to enrich glycated species followed by mass spectrometry for structural characterization and activity assays for functional assessment. This approach was applied to a (temperature-stressed) lipase used for food applications revealing that storage at -20 °C and 4 °C resulted in minor glycation (below 9%), whereas storage at 25 °C led to a higher glycation level with up to four sugars per lipase molecule. Remarkably, activity measurements revealed that glycation did not reduce lipase activity or stability. Altogether, this novel strategy is a helpful extension to the current analytical toolbox supporting development of enzyme products.
