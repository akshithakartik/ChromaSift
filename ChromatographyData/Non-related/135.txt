Title: Chemistry and biological activities of naturally occurring C-glycosylxanthones

Abstract: The xanthones represent an important and widely spread class of specialized metabolites in the plant kingdom, fungi, and lichens. Their aromatic and highly oxygenated structures owe them the ability to undergo a series of chemical reactions to form an important number of derivatives as well as to exert a large scale of excellent activities that particularly increased their interest for several researchers. Amongst the reactions observed on their basic nucleus, C-glycosylation leads to the formation of C-glycosylxanthones, a rare subclass of xanthones encountered in nature. Until July 2023, the literature survey on chemical and pharmacological investigations of medicinal plants indicated that a total of 41 distinct natural C-glycosylxanthones have been isolated from 31 plant species belonging to 10 families. Mangiferin (1) was the most reported one and the most biologically screened. Antioxidant activity was the most performed test on isolated compounds, while some strong and good anti-inflammatory, antiplasmodial, and Î±-glucosidase inhibitory activities have been also reported in the literature for some C-glycosylxanthones. This paper is a mini-review summarizing the occurrence, chemistry, and biological activities of C-glycosylxanthones. The writing of this paper has been done using the literature collected from online libraries including SciFinder, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using keywords xanthone, glycosyl, C-glycosylxanthone, without language restriction. This review represents therefore the easiest access to the information on C-glycosylxanthones for researchers intending to also continue the research investigations on this topic.
