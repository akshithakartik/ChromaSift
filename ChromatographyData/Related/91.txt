Title: Liquid-liquid chromatography isolation of Petasites hybridus sesquiterpenes and their LC-HR-MS/MS and NMR characterization

Abstract: Petasites hybridus L. (butterbur, Asteraceae) is a well-known medicinal plant traditionally used as a remedy for neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal disorders. Eremophilane-type sesquiterpenes (petasins) are considered to be the major bioactive constituents of butterbur. However, efficient methods to isolate high-purity petasins in sufficient amounts for further analytical and biological testing are lacking. In this study, various sesquiterpenes were separated from a methanol rootstock extract of P. hybridus with liquid-liquid chromatography (LLC). The appropriate biphasic solvent system was selected using the predictive thermodynamic model COSMO-RS and shake-flask experiments. After the selection of the feed (extract) concentration and operating flow rate, a batch LLC experiment was performed with n-hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water 5/1/5/1 (v/v/v/v). For those LLC fractions containing petasin derivatives with purities < 95%, a preparative high-performance liquid chromatography purification step followed. All isolated compounds were identified by state-of-the-art spectroscopic methods, i.e., liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. As a result, six compounds were obtained, namely 8β-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8-olide, 2-[(angeloyl)oxy]eremophil-7(11)-en-12,8-olide, 8α/β-H-eremophil-7(11)-en-12,8-olide, neopetasin, petasin, and isopetasin. The isolated petasins can be further used as reference materials for standardization and pharmacological evaluation.
