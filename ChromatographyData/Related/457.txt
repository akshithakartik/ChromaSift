Title: Modified aqueous mobile phases: A way to improve retention behavior of active pharmaceutical compounds and their impurities in liquid chromatography

Abstract: Most commonly used analytical technique for determination of active pharmaceutical ingredients and their impurities in quality control throughout all phases of drug research, development and manufacture is definitely reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). However, pharmaceutical industry professionals are often faced with various challenges in RP mode, which cannot be resolved with common variations in the composition of the mobile phase. These challenges often occur when analyzing compounds that contain basic ionizable groups, possess large differences in polarities and require consumption of high amounts of toxic organic solvents. Among available strategies for addressing the aforementioned issues, the most convenient one includes RP-HPLC mobile phase modifications by an addition of the proper chemical compounds. In that respect, RP-HPLC method can be easily adapted to the needs of the analysis without time-consuming and expensive equipment procurement. In this review the chaotropic chromatography, micellar liquid chromatography, and cyclodextrin modified RP-HPLC systems are presented and discussed in details. Special attention is devoted to the theoretical background, the possibility of retention modeling and applications in various fields of pharmacy, as well as their prospective in further research.
