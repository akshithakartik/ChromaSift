Title: Rice husk-derived mesoporous biogenic silica nanoparticles for gravity chromatography

Abstract: Biogenic silica nanoparticle is a superb alternative to synthetic silica because of their highly active, polar, and porous nanostructure with a large interior area. Among the available agricultural bioresources, biogenic silica extracted from rice husks could be a simple, easily available, and cost-effective resource to use as the stationary phase for the column chromatographic technique. In the present study, highly pure amorphous biogenic silica nanoparticles (bSNPs) were synthesized using rice husk by a controlled combustion route followed by the sol-gel method. The bSNPs show better performance for the separation and isolation of ortho- and para-nitrophenol and nitroaniline. The outstanding performance of the as-synthesized bSNPs is attributed to the high surface area, high porosity, and presence of Siâ€“OH polar bonds. These preliminary findings imply that rice husk, an agricultural waste, could be an alternative source of silica and applicable as a stationary phase in column chromatography.
