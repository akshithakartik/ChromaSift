Title: External stimuli-responsive gasotransmitter prodrugs: Chemistry and spatiotemporal release

Abstract: Gasotransmitters like nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide with unique pleiotropic pharmacological effects in mammals are an emerging therapeutic modality for different human diseases including cancer, infection, ischemia-reperfusion injuries, and inflammation; however, their clinical translation is hampered by the lack of a reliable delivery form, which delivers such gasotransmitters to the action site with precisely controlled dosage. The external stimuli-responsive prodrug strategy has shown tremendous potential in developing gasotransmitter prodrugs, which affords precise temporospatial control and better dose control compared with endogenous stimuli-sensitive prodrugs. The promising external stimuli employed for gasotransmitter activation range from photo, ultrasound, and bioorthogonal click chemistry to exogenous enzymes. Herein, we highlight the recent development of external stimuli-mediated decaging chemistry for the temporospatial delivery of gasotransmitters including nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, and discuss the pros and cons of different designs.
