Title: Randomized controlled trial of urinE chemiStry guided aCute heArt faiLure treATmEnt (ESCALATE): Rationale and design

Abstract: Diuresis to achieve decongestion is a central aim of therapy in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). While multiple clinical trials have investigated initial diuretic strategies for a designated period of time, there is a paucity of evidence to guide diuretic titration strategies continued until decongestion is achieved. The use of urine chemistries (urine sodium and creatinine) in a natriuretic response prediction equation accurately estimates natriuresis in response to diuretic dosing, but a randomized clinical trial is needed to compare a urine chemistry-guided diuresis strategy with a strategy of usual care. The urinE chemiStry guided aCute heArt faiLure treATmEnt (ESCALATE) trial is designed to test the hypothesis that protocolized diuretic therapy guided by spot urine chemistry through completion of intravenous diuresis will be superior to usual care and improve outcomes over the 14 days following randomization. ESCALATE will randomize and obtain complete data on 450 patients with acute heart failure to a diuretic strategy guided by urine chemistry or a usual care strategy. Key inclusion criteria include an objective measure of hypervolemia with at least 10 pounds of estimated excess volume, and key exclusion criteria include significant valvular stenosis, hypotension, and a chronic need for dialysis. Our primary outcome is days of benefit over the 14 days after randomization. Days of benefit combines patient symptoms captured by global clinical status with clinical state quantifying the need for hospitalization and intravenous diuresis.
