Title: Reactivity-based identification of oxygen containing functional groups of chemicals applied as potential classifier in non-target analysis.

Abstract: In this work, we developed a reactivity-based strategy to identify functional groups of unknown analytes, which can be applied as classifier in non-target analysis with gas chromatography. The aim of this strategy is to reduce the number of potential candidate structures generated for a molecular formula determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. We selected an example of 18 isomers with the molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to test the performance of different derivatization reagents, whereas our aim was to select mild and fast reaction conditions. Based on the results for the isomers, we developed a four-step workflow for the identification of functional groups containing oxygen.
