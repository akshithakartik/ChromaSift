Title: Optimization of a ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry method for monitoring haloacetic acids as chlorinated disinfection by-products in the fresh-cut industry

Abstract: Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are one of the most important chlorinated disinfection by-products generated during water disinfection in the fresh-cut industry, and they can remain in the product, resulting in a consumer health risk. In this study, ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MRM) analysis used for drinking water was optimized and applied for the quantification of nine HAAs (HAA9) in fresh-cut lettuce and process water samples, with the complex matrix interferences for separation, and quantification problems. The method showed good selectivity, specificity and linearity, satisfactory values for trueness (recoveries of 80–116 %), precision (<22 %), and uncertainty (<55 %). Quantification limits varied from 1 to 5 µg L−1 or µg kg−1. The matrix effect for tribromoacetic, bromochloroacetic and chlorodibromoacetic acid was corrected by matrix-matched calibration and standard addition. After storage at -20 °C, only monobromoacetic acid was the HAA which loss happened after 7 days. The application of the methodology in lettuce and process water samples from the industry was successfully implemented. Therefore, this method could be employed for the quality control and regulatory analysis of HAAs in fresh products and process water from the fruit and vegetable industry.
