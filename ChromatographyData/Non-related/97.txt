Title: Holoreact: chemistry experiment game with hologram based to enhance learning on senior high school level

Abstract: The survey conducted on 104 students from 14 schools through online questionnaires found that students considered chemistry as a complex subject. This is also supported by the declining score result from chemistry's National Examination, specifically in the analytic chemistry section for the past three years. Based on the survey, students were interested in learning chemistry through an experiment hologram-based game because it is more immersive and easier to observe. Hence a chemistry experiment hologram-based game is made using the ELEKTRA method, which aims to teach high-school chemistry concepts for analytic chemistry. The test result from students showed an increase of understanding for 47% - 62% in both pre and post-experiment quiz scores. Based on the expert's interview result, the game's content has been compatible with the current high school curriculum.
