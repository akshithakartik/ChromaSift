Title: A large-scale, targeted metabolomics method for the analysis and quantification of metabolites in human plasma via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry

Abstract: Metabolomics is the study of small molecules, primarily metabolites, that are produced during metabolic processes. Analysis of the composition of an organism's metabolome can yield useful information about an individual's health status at any given time. In recent years, the development of large-scale, targeted metabolomic methods has allowed for the analysis of biological samples using analytical techniques such as LC-MS/MS. This paper presents a large-scale metabolomics method for analysis of biological samples, with a focus on quantification of metabolites found in blood plasma. The method comprises a 10-min chromatographic separation using HILIC and RP stationary phases combined with positive and negative electrospray ionization in order to maximize metabolome coverage. Complete analysis of a single sample can be achieved in as little as 40Â min using the two columns and dual modes of ionization. With 540 metabolites and the inclusion of over 200 analytical standards, this method is comprehensive and quantitatively robust when compared to current targeted metabolomics methods. This study uses a large-scale evaluation of metabolite recovery from plasma that enables absolute quantification of metabolites by correcting for analyte loss throughout processes such as extraction, handling, or storage. In addition, the method was applied to plasma collected from adjuvant breast cancer patients to confirm the suitability of the method to clinical samples.
