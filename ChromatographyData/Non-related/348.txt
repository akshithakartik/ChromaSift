Title: Green chemistry: its opportunities and challenges in colouration and chemical finishing of textiles

Abstract: Green chemistry is a discipline that can be applied across various stages in the production and processing of textiles. This article attempts to study the varied applications of green chemistry in the textile industry and to evaluate the areas where one can deploy its principles and review the need for and importance of switching to environmentally friendlier practices. The review sets its ground by discussing the needs of green chemistry and its utilization in textile colouration and a few prominent textile finishing segments. Different applications of green chemistry in textiles are discussed elaborately, especially in the field of textile colouration, and a few important classes of finishes like antimicrobial, flame retardancy, water repellent and crease-resistant finishes (vis-Ã -vis conventional finishing chemicals). The existing chemicals and their toxicological hazards are discussed, and hence there is an utmost importance of sustainable chemistry. The latest trends in the manufacture of sustainable chemicals to endow the different finishes are also discussed in the subsequent sections. The applications of green chemistry are promising, yet challenging and different future perspectives are highlighted at the concluding part of this review.
